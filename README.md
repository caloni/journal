Hi. This is the source from my [blogue] posts published 
using [GitHub Pages].

This repo should stay private. It contains work journal and
sensitive data. The public folder will contain publishable
content, but I am publishing my ebook with the work journal,
so I think this will depend of the public =).

If you just cloned this repo start by reading some scripts. 
I used an operating system called Windows, but it is is pretty
workable from Unix env, since uses gawk and stuff. You guys are
using Unix stuff yet, right?

Thank you, person from the future, for the interest into my
texts. Hope you find something useful here. Bye bye and thank
you for all the steak.
