Such "things," however, dissolve back into energy dances — processes, or verbs — when the nervous system is synergized with certain drugs or transmuted by yogic or shamanic exercises or aided by scientific instruments.

And here is the issue, the classic challenge of philosophy: to expand inner neurological reality and to link it with the outer realities measured by scientists. Intelligence evolves when the occult and magical become the objective-scientific.

Bohr suggested that the search for one correct model was medieval, pre-scientific and obsolete. We can best understand sub-atomic events, he said, if we accept the necessity of allowing for more than one model.

(According to economist Oscar Morgenstern and mathematician John von Neumann, in their epochal Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, most human transactions can be analyzed mathematically by treating them as if they were games.

“We’ve got a contract among ourselves,” he said, “that we’re going to talk sense, and that means specifying where the bodies are in space-time and what sort of signals they’re exchanging.”

What was happening in interpersonal relations, described objectively and relativistically, was various parties or coalitions bargaining for control of neuro-muscular space (ethnological territory) or the right to define the game for all other players (ideological territory).

He had developed a seven-dimensional game model and insisted on analyzing all behavior in terms of the (1) roles being played (2) rules tacitly accepted by all players; (3) strategies for winning (or for masochistic winning-by-losing); (4) goals of the game, purpose served; (5) language of the game, and the semantic world-view implied; (6) characteristic space-time locations, and (7) characteristic movements in space-time.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Leary added, was “the manual for one type of consciousness-altering game.” It was useful for LSD-reprogramming sessions because LSD “suspends imprinted neurological games” and allows us to “imprint new games.”

In the seminars on Exo-Psychology which I teach these days, I dramatize this point by having the entire class visualize the hall they came through in entering the seminar room. Then I ask how many people visualize five distinct items, ten, fifteen . . . When we find the person with the largest number of distinct signals in memory storage, we list the elements of that person’s hall on the blackboard. We call this number X. Then we collect all the signals from the rest of the class that were not on the list, X. The new list is always higher than 2X. That is, if the memory champ of that class had 14 signals in the hall, the total class had 28 or more.

This illustrates that one way to double your practical intelligence (awareness of detail) is to try to receive as many signals as possible from other humans, however wrong-headed their reality-map may seem, however dumb or boring they might sound at first. Our usual habit of screening out all human signals not immediately compatible with our own favorite reality-map is the mechanism which keeps us all far stupider than we should be.
