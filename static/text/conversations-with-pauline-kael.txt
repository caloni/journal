“When Shoeshine opened in 1947, I went to see it alone after one of those terrible lovers’ quarrels that leave one in a state of incomprehensible despair. I came out of the theater, tears streaming, and overheard the petulant voice of a college girl complaining to her boyfriend, ‘Well, I don’t see what was so special about that movie.’ I walked up the street, crying blindly, no longer certain whether my tears were for the tragedy on the screen, the hopelessness I felt for myself, or the alienation I felt from those who could not experience the radiance of Shoeshine. For if people cannot feel Shoeshine what can they feel?”)

“You have to recognize what is important for the art of the movies,” she says. “The movies that have the big publicity budgets and the advertising, they will take care of themselves. I mean, the critic is the answer to advertising, mostly because the advertising protects. The critic is the only protection for the art of the film for which there isn’t a big budget and a lot of advertising. A movie like The Conformist is exactly the kind where you’ve got to help that director [Bernardo Bertolucci] keep working because he is a major talent. It was the same with Godard’s early films, or Bonnie and Clyde, or China Is Near, or Bob Altman—when Fox didn’t know what they had in M*A*S*H—or Fred Wiseman’s documentaries. If there’s a chance that you can help, you do. And so the deficiencies you minimize, I mean just instinctively. If you’re sane you just have to.”

But I do think that this generation wants what Bogart had, what someone like Garfield had. The men gave the appearance of being secure in themselves as men, and that’s very important to women. It’s going to become more important as things become more insecure in our culture, as I think they may become. Girls are going to want this image on the screen and they are going to need it.

Kael has long defended the passion and energy of American filmmaking against those who would censor or dismiss it. But now, of the two paths of commercial film—one, toward safe banality, the other toward a technician’s approach to emotional manipulation—neither is likely to generate the kind of greatness in moviemaking that she was able to find in, say, Bonnie and Clyde. Then, against a tide of protest against the film’s violence, she argued, “Our best movies have always made entertainment out of the anti-heroism of American life.” Yes, she wrote, the film was violent and audiences “should feel uncomfortable, but this isn’t an argument against the movie.” Her defense of filmmakers’ right to make audiences uncomfortable goes on, but the films often don’t bother to claim the right.

I think a lot of what’s happened is simply that the movie companies have been able to take the risk factor out of financing movies, by selling them in advance to TV, international TV, cable, Home Box Office, as well as selling them in advance to theaters. They will not take a risk on projects that are not desirable for TV. They want to get all their money guaranteed in advance.

The only time it’s fun to write about bad movies is when they’re being universally praised and you know they’ll make a lot of money and you want to tell people why you think they’re being suckered, or if a picture has a huge campaign and people are taking it as a work of art and you think it’s not very good.

Older people often take violence in movies awfully seriously, when the audience doesn’t necessarily take it that seriously. Obviously the violence of Mean Streets is very different from the violence of Dawn of the Dead. Mean Streets and Taxi Driver are both wonderful movies that upset people on a different level. It upsets you the way art often does. I don’t see how you can have art that investigates certain areas of experience without upsetting people. I mean, Macbeth is very upsetting. King Lear is almost intolerable, if it’s done well.

Is it left or is it liberal, or moralistic? Mostly liberal, but in some cases it’s left. Because there’s nothing directly political you may not see that they’re really left wing, that movies in those years did represent the lib-lab point of view. I would say the first big movie to swing the other way is The Deer Hunter. That and the Clint Eastwood movies do represent a right-wing consciousness. It’s not explicitly political—they’re just right wingers. But most of the movies were the other way, definitively. Certainly there were a lot of moralistic films. But it’s more than that. If you saw Midnight Cowboy—the society was shown as corrupt, desperate, callous. America would have been shown as different in an earlier period. That kind of thing happened during the Vietnam period.

The reason there aren’t more good producers is because the deal has become so important. They’re getting their money anyway; they’re getting it presold, so nobody worries about artistic unity.

It’s a tug of war, although sometimes film audiences are very passive. Younger movie goers who have watched a lot of television seem to be more passive than previous generations of movie goers. In previous generations kids went to movies once a week. The Saturday afternoon they spent at the movies was the only experience of that kind that they had and they often spent the rest of the week talking about the movie with other kids and they developed critical and emotional responses to it. Kids now watch television and when the program’s over, or even in the middle, they turn to the next one. There’s always more television going on on other channels so they never really talk about what they’ve seen in the same way. It isn’t an intense experience that stays with them and they’re less likely to develop critical reactions.

I worked to loosen my style—to get away from the term-paper pomposity that we learn at college. I wanted the sentences to breathe, to have the sound of a human voice. I began, for example, to interject remarks—interrupting a train of thought, just as we do when we talk, and then picking it up again. And when I began to feel the freedom to write as easily as I spoke, the writing itelf became pleasurable.

The amazing thing is that the movies that are most successful now are often the most mediocre. Advertising has become so overwhelming, we’re so inundated with it, that most people never hear about the oddball good little movies that show up. And they go to Rambo and Rocky IV and the pictures that get the biggest campaigns. Then that process keeps going because then the newspapers have all their follow-up stories from this great hit, and everybody feels they have to see it because so many other people are seeing it.

It’s something that many people on the outside don’t seem to realize. They think of criticism simply as judgment. They don’t think of it as exploration of themes or performances, or of making connections and flashes of perception and jumping ahead sometimes to see what the director is trying to get at even if he doesn’t get it. It becomes a kind of intuitive process. If I outlined a review, I’d never write it, because the fun for me is discovering the connections as I write.

When I started writing for magazines in the ’50s I was dissatisfied with the studied, academic tone of my first pieces. I hated fancy writing, and I tried to write as simply as possible. I was conscious of the fact that I was writing about a popular art form. I don’t think I would have written in the same way if I had been writing about classical music. How can you deal with movies truthfully, in terms of your responses, if you don’t use contractions, if you don’t use “you” instead of “one”? I mean, I’m not a goddamned Englishman. I don’t say, “One likes this movie very much.”

What broke me loose from academic writing was that I wrote a lot of advertising copy anonymously—and unsigned notes for the theaters I managed. Writing in an unsigned form frees you of the inhibitions of academic writing. I was just trying to reach the public as directly as possible. And I found that I was doing it more naturally. It’s mainly a kind of courage that you need in order to write the way you think instead of writing the way you’ve been taught.

It seeps into you. It’s in the environment. I’ve heard of people getting jobs as movie critics and then watching ten classics to get educated in movies. The whole thought makes me want to throw darts at them. If you haven’t picked up an education in movies from what’s available in your area, from television and from VCRs, what’s the point? You can never catch up. Sure, you can pick out some of the great ones to go see, but that’s not the same thing as seeing what the great ones spring out of, which is all the crap. Part of getting to know movies is sorting out the great ones from the crap for yourself, seeing all those lousy Warner Brothers movies, out of which the really good ones came, and there’s no way you can educate yourself in that.

I did think Eastwood’s performance in In the Line of Fire was one of the best he’s ever given, perhaps the best. But when he was fun in his early movies it wasn’t because of his acting skill, and now that he has a little skill he’s lost the spaghetti sexiness that made him fun. He’s all sinews.

There’s no standard to judge right or wrong by in any of the arts. You have to go on whether other people see something different in the work because of what you’ve written. In movies, judgment is often not so important in a critic as responsiveness to what a movie feels like, and where it’s heading and what its vision is.

RS: What do you think of the British movie critics? PK: Graham Greene could summarize a movie in two or three sentences that were just about unforgettable. He could do it with a phrase. And he had a strong point of view about what kinds of movies he believed in. There are some remarkably smart critics now, but you feel they could be writing about almost anything. It wouldn’t have to be movies.
