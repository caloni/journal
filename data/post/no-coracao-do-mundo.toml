"plot outline" = "The film is situated in a rundown neighbourhood in Contagem near Belo Horizonte - the area where the directors come from. All younger people are dreaming of a better life. The older ones have probably given up. Women in general are prepared to do honest work, men are mostly lazy and try criminal short cuts to The Heart of the World, which is short for Paradise. We follow the lifes of six or seven residents, which is fascinating but depressing. Technically the film is well made, and although we jump from one life to another - the general line is clear and exciting. The end is a genuine shocker."
