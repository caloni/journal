"plot outline" = "Júlio (Roberto Bomtempo), a journalist and Márcia (Maitê Proença), a lawyer decided that fidelity would not be the basis of their marriage. Nothing of the crimes of passion, irrational quarrels, nor divorces. The couple wanted only to live, to love, to raise their teenage daughter, Guida and to remain free. At first idealistic, they end up undergoing a 'normal' life, but this did not include overturning the agreement on possible extra-marital activities. She tells him that she had sex with Teodoro, a client of hers. Even when he is annoyed, and jealous he accepts, exercising his tolerance. Shortly after, while they spend a weekend at their country home he meets his daughter's free spirited friend, Anamaria who seems to be the embodiment of his most secret desires."
