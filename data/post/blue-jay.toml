"plot outline" = "Beginning - At first they seem very, awkward and of course they have nothing to say to each other, it's been years. They go out to get some coffee and they bond for a while, you start to see their friendship, Amanda seems reserved whilst Jim seems more forward and more talkative. It just happens that they both left their hometown, sort of symbolizes their fear of having to confront their past for years to come. But they both come back and happen to run into each other, just coincidental."
