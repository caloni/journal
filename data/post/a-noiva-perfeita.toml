"plot outline" = "At 43, Luis is a confirmed bachelor, happy with one night stands, a success as a creator of perfumes. He has one problem: his mother and five sisters, who form an intimidating family council, want him married. Luis contrives to hire a woman to pose as a fiancée who will jilt him at the altar, leaving him disconsolate, with an excuse not to marry. He hires Emma, the sister of a colleague. She restores antique furniture and wants to adopt a child from Brazil. Things go too well: when Emma doesn't show up at the wedding, Luis's mother requires hospitalization; only Emma can bring her out of her swoon. It's time for a new plan that involves more tangled webs. And the child?"
