"plot outline" = "Some Icelanders maintain a strong and mysterious relationship with Snaefellsjökull, a volcano- glacier located in the West of the island. This volcano has become universally celebrated thanks to Jules Verne who indicated that it was the gateway leading to the center of the Earth. THE MYSTERIES OF SNÆFELLSJÖKULL is an audiovisual report, an investigation compiling witnesses and documents but also a visionary voyage which confronts the audience to the legends surrounding this mythical mountain by taking them into a universe similar to that of fantasy tales."
