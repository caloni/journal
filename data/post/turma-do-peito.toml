"plot outline" = "New mother Audrey is having a hard time adjusting to motherhood. Exhausted, struggling to breastfeed, and lacking support from her husband, her selfish and flighty mother, and friends who don't invite her out clubbing, she turns to a new-mothers' group and finds a mixed bag of women and one man who are all in the same boat. They are united by their horror birth stories, sleepless nights, and loss of identity. The Letdown is a humorous yet truthful insight into new parenthood, a must-watch that will make you reminisce and cry at the same time."
