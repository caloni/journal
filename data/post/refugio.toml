"plot outline" = "Middle-aged graphic design company manager Michel loves planes. Day and night - in the shower, at work, riding his scooter - he dreams of life as an airborne explorer. Then one day a photograph stops him dead in his tracks. Kayaks - they could almost be planes, planes without wings. Seized by a sudden crazy impulse, Michel orders the whole package online: canoe, paddles - everything he needs for an expedition. His wife Rachelle encourages him to set out alone on his escapade. So what if he's never rowed a boat in his life? Adventure is adventure. His big trip on the water turns out to be full of surprises and unexpected encounters: Laetitia, the owner of a riverside bar, her crazy employees, the young waitress Mila - after a night in their company, Michel finds it very hard to leave."
