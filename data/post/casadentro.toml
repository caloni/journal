"plot outline" = "Ms. Pilar, almost 81, shares her quiet house situated in a provincial part of Peru with Consuelo, Milagros and Tuna. The daily routine in this household, where one day could be confused with any other, revolves around insignificant events.The telephone interrupts the stillness. It's Patricia, one of Pilars daughters, calling to say that she will be arriving in a few hours with her daughter, her daughters husband and her granddaughter in tow. Pilar nervously agrees and immediately starts to worry. The household routine is forced to change. In this film coexist three generations of mothers. They are forced to interact with one another, to face and also ignore each other, to spend a night together under the same roof."
