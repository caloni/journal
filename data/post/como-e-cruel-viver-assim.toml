"plot outline" = "Best known in Brazil for her romantic comedies, Julia Rezende shifts gears in her fifth feature film with this dark Coen Brothers-like drama about four friends -Vladimir, his wife Clivia, Regina and Primo- who concoct an outrageous plan to get out of their financial doldrums: to kidnap a millionaire ,Regina's former boss. The only problem? They lack experience and the proper 'criminal' element in their individual souls. As the plan moves forward, their frustrations, ambitions and fears emerge, often hilariously."
