"plot outline" = "Spring of 1999: 15-year-old Camille and 19-year-old Sullivan are mad about each other. Sullivan, however, wants to go to South America for a year and this drives Camille to despair. He leaves in the fall and after a while he stops writing to her. After a suicide attempt, she ends up in the hospital. After four years she works, studies architecture and lives alone. She meets a famous architect, Lorenz, who restores her self-confidence. In 2007, Camille and Lorenz have a strong relationship. She is his assistant but she feels strong enough to set up an agency soon. She develops into a more fully formed woman, with new interests. After 7 years she sees Sullivan again. After their first meeting everything seems to go well, but a few months later the old feelings come back and her heart is torn again."
