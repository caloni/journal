"plot outline" = "Both Sherko (S) and Mokhtar (M) are in love with Najla (N). She is so with S while M works in the dictator's police. N had just finished her medical studies in Rome, but intended to go on and becoming a specialized doctor - when she receives a letter from S saying that she must forget him. She returns to Iraq and finds S after much difficulty. He has concealed a number of sick or injured fugitives in a house but can give them neither treatment nor even cleanliness. He says that she can be shot just for meeting him. M had followed her trail and the police arrests both N and S. After N had been beaten up a friendly officer tells that she had done a very great service by finding S. He had already posted a report according to which she voluntarily came and wanted to work for the police. She accepts the work as a police doctor, not because of cowardice but because she can collect and pass on information: the names of those who are murdered or tortured. She stops an execution of women and children by fabricating that a child had signs of cholera and soldiers could die. Eventually M helps N and S to escape, and at the frontier he distracts the guards. When caught he takes the full responsibility for the escape. He is shot. When N learns that she returns and is also shot. Then S is alone."
