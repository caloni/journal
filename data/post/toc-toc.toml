"plot outline" = "In the waiting room of an international well-known doctor expert in treatments for TOC ('Trastorno Obsesivo Compulsivo'; Spanish for 'Obsesive Compulsive Disorder' or OCD) meet some people who by a malfunction of a new computer program have been dated the same day at the same time. In the group are the next: Emilio, a taxi driver expert in astronomical mathematical calculation who too is affected of Diogenes Syndrome (hoarder disorder); Blanca, a lab worker who suffers of mysophobia, an extreme panic to all virus and bacteria; Ana María, a prayerful religious with disorder of verification; Otto, a young guy with obsession by symmetry unable to step the cracks in the pavement lines; Lili, a nice young girl and gym coach who is affected at the same time by palilalia (unintentional repetition of quotes, words and syllables said by oneself) and echolalia (unintentional repetition of quotes, words and syllables said by other person); and finally Federico, a mature aspiring lawyer affected by Tourette Syndrome, forcing him unwittingly to say all kind of profanities and making obscene gestures. After a tense first contact between them, it increases when Tiffany, Dr. Palomero's receptionist, reports them that the airplane of the doctor delays from London. It causes that Federico suggests to the others share their different OCDs in the hope to find a cure, starting a series of events each time more crazy."
