"plot outline" = "In the periphery of São Paulo, the very low middle-class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of Teodoro, Cláudia and the teenager Soninha have deep secrets. The religious Teodoro is indeed a hit-man, hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro. He has a lover, the very devout woman Terezinha, and he wants to regenerate, going to the country with her. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio, who delivers meats for his father's butcher shop. Soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery, having active sexual life, smoking grass and loving heavy metal. When Júlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood, the lives of the members of the family change."
