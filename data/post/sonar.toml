"plot outline" = "Thomas, a 34-years-old sound engineer, has a well-orderd life, balanced between his work for the radio, the bands for which he records and the sound portraits that he would like to carry out. Often locked up in his studio, he prefers having himself surrounded by sounds rather than by people. Fred, his nice and portly alter ego, blames him for his solitary behaviour. Thomas has a shallow relationship with his mother. After one of his rare visits to her place in the provinces, he records sounds on a motorway and meets Amina, a 22 year-old young and pretty girl from the Maghreb who works there. A fight with her boss compels Thomas to interfere. Amina asks him if she could leave with him, she implies she is in danger. Thomas tries to avoid it but he finally agrees to have her at his place for a night or two."
