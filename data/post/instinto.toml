"plot outline" = "Nicoline, an experienced psychologist, starts a new job at a penal institution, despite the fact that she resolved to never return to psychiatry. She meets Idris, an intelligent man with an anti-social, narcissistic personality disorder, who committed a series of grave sexual offenses. After five years of treatment, he is about to go on his first unaccompanied probation. His team of practitioners are enthusiastic about his development and behavior, but newcomer Nicoline does not trust him an inch. She tries to push his probation to the astonishment of her coworkers. Idris tries his hardest to convince Nicoline of his good intentions, but as she remains sceptical, he slowly but surely grows violent. He transforms into the manipulative man Nicoline saw in him from the beginning. A power play emerges between the two and Nicoline, in spite of her knowledge and experience, lets herself be trapped completely."
