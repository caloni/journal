"plot outline" = "As Sherlock attempts to comfort John Watson after his wife's death, entrepreneur and apparent philanthropist Culverton Smith tests a new drug on his employees and his daughter Faith to make them forget his confession that he plans to commit murder. Faith retains a partial memory and approaches Sherlock to identify a likely victim but her disappearance, and his descent into drug abuse, lands him in Smith's hospital and at his mercy. Though Sherlock is not as helpless as he appears and has his own way of trapping Smith, the final shock is reserved for Watson as his new therapist springs a terrible surprise on him."
