Subir escadas
Journaling and coding
Não é o Ulisses, é o salto
Para se comprometer é preciso estar tranquilo

Reality is literally a waking dream. You can control the dream. You can create moments. Moments filled with pain, loneliness, war. Moments of absolute bliss. Watching your firstborn open her eyes for the first time. If you’re kind to the universe, the universe will be kind to you. It’s your choice. It’s filled with potential. And I know by helping you to see it, my grand work here will be far-reaching when I’m gone.
