title: Leituras e experiência sobre jejum intermitente
---

Meu padrão alimentar está claro para mim. Ficar em jejum por um tempo é um exercício previsto e que exerço como uma rotina por muitos anos. Após se acostumar o impacto é baixo, tanto da fome quanto da escolha. Porém, fazer restrição calórica, ou seja, comer apenas um pouco, me causa ansiedade. A ansiedade, por sua vez, é o que desencadeia medidas precipitadas, como ingerir açúcar e outros alimentos no impulso, me impedindo de sentir a experiência de comer calmamente. O foco está mais na quantidade consumida no momento do impulso. Enquanto essa satisfação não chega, e demora para chegar, o impulso continua, geralmente alienando tudo que estou consumindo no momento. Não existe consciência nesse momento, apenas instinto se "justificando" com o racional. Após esse período, chega uma leve culpa ou remorso. Esse relato não foge muito do que já foi estudado pela ciência, o que é bom. E uma coisa é certa: as soluções para este comportamento nunca podem ser punitivas ou exageradas, pois o efeito rebote sempre faz piorar esse impulso, que se assemelha muito a um vício.

Estou lendo textos do site WeFast, onde um grupo de mulheres decidiu reunir conteúdo de cunho científico formatado para leigos sobre como mulheres podem se aproveitar de jejum intermitente para diminuir a incidência de doenças relacionadas ao desequilíbrio alimentar. É um grupo focado para mulheres, mas ainda melhor, pois mulheres sofrem mais para fazer jejum (isso é fato), o que pode ajudar os mais fracos de força de vontade também, mulheres ou não. Segue abaixo os recortes dessas leituras, o que pode ser usado mais tarde para o meu texto de como jejum funciona.


# [Say Goodbye To Sugar Cravings With Intermittent Fasting]

> Insulin regulates blood sugar levels. When you eat, blood sugar levels rise, and insulin is released. The food consumed is converted to energy for the body. But if you consume more than your body needs, the excess is stored as fat. When your body is in a fasted state, insulin levels are very low, and the body turns to the stored fat to burn for energy.

> When one stays in a fasted state for a long period, leptin levels start to drop. This may cause feelings of increased hunger and desires for sugar the first couple of weeks. As leptin levels normalize, hunger and sugar cravings subside and in time the sugar craving cycle can be broken.

> Leptin is released from fat cells. It creates a feeling of fullness and suppresses appetite for a period. It tells the brain you are full and to start burning calories for energy. When leptin levels increase, metabolism speeds up in normal-weight individuals.

> Women may find it difficult to overcome leptin resistance because they naturally have higher leptin levels than men.

>
> Here are a few tips to help you with sugar cravings until your body can normalize leptin levels and the desires go away:
>
>  - Drink sugar-free liquids allowed during the fast.
>  - Use peppermint essential oil that is safe for ingestion in your water during the fast.
>  - Chew sugar-free gum during your eating window
>  - Make sure to eat enough unprocessed foods during your eating window that include healthy carbohydrates such as fruits and quinoa.
>  - Stay busy and out of the kitchen.
>  - Keep your hands occupied, and your mind distracted.
>  - Dig deep and remember all the healthy reasons you want to reduce your sugar consumption.

# [How Intermittent Fasting can help you Sleep better]

> Insulin is produced by the pancreas. The pancreas is highly sensitive to melatonin. Because you are fasting when you sleep, the body doesn't need high insulin levels to deal with rising blood sugar. Melatonin binds to receptors in the pancreas, slowing down insulin production.

>
> One of the bonuses of intermittent fasting is that it triggers the production of the human growth hormone, which naturally depletes with age. The human growth hormone (HgH) is produced during sleep and has amazing benefits for the body, including:
>
>  - Maintains, builds, and repairs healthy tissues in the brain and other organs.
>  - Burns fat
>  - Boosts metabolism.
>  - Builds muscle mass.
>  - Slows aging process.
>  - Improves quality and appearance of skin.
>  - Speeds up healing and muscle repair.
>

> One study showed that after a week of intermittent fasting, people woke up in the night less frequently, moved around in their sleep less, spent more time in the deep REM stage of sleep, and reported better overall sleep quality.


# [Intermittent Fasting And Hormones For A Better Balance]

>
> There are a few main hormones, which you can “fix” with intermittent fasting and help yourself to achieve better health conditions:
>
>  - Insulin
>  - Leptin
>  - Growth hormone
>  - Ghrelin
>  - Sex hormones
>  - Thyroid hormones
>

> High levels of insulin are also called hyperinsulinemia. When you develop such a condition, your body becomes insensitive to the hormone and leads to resistance and in the end, your cells are not able to get needed energy and essential nutrients and you starve from inside. At the same time, your body tries to “fix” the situation by releasing more insulin that worsens the resistance even more.

> You can call leptin the main satiety hormone. It is mostly secreted by fat cells (adipocytes) and gives the signal to our brain that there is enough “potential energy” (read fat) to survive, so we don’t need to consume more food.

> When we keep eating, we store food for later use as fat and our adipocytes get enlarged and they “scream” STOP EATING by producing a lot of leptin. Similarly to insulin, constantly high leptin levels lead to leptin resistance. As a result, our brain stops reacting to the signals and instead of feeling satiated, we feel hungry all the time, we eat more, we store more fat and we develop even stronger resistance to leptin.

> Opposite to satiety hormone leptin, our body releases the “hunger hormone”-ghrelin at certain times and the level of this hormone drops down after a meal. Imbalance in this hormone is associated with increased food intake, which leads to obesity. Studies show that overweight and obese people have just a slight drop in ghrelin levels after a meal, which means that they are still hungry even if they’ve eaten.

> Human growth hormone (HGH) is essential for cell regeneration and reproduction, bone density, strong immune system and speed of metabolism. We lose the ability to produce this hormone with ageing, but studies show that intermittent fasting dramatically triggers an increase in HGH as a protective mechanism for bone and tissue.


# [How does intermittent fasting help with insulin resistance]

> When you eat something, your blood sugar rises. The pancreas then secretes insulin to lower your blood sugar. Muscle cells take sugar from the blood for immediate use. But the muscles and liver can also store sugar (as glycogen) for later use.

> As soon as blood sugar levels return to the normal range, insulin also returns to normal. Now, the stored energy can be accessed. The body first uses its stored sugar. This helps to keep the blood sugar stable in between meals. The more sugar storage gets depleted, the more fat is released from the fat cells.

> Meal --> Blood sugar and insulin go up --> What is not immediately needed is stored for later use --> Blood sugar and insulin return to normal --> Energy stores are used until the next meal.

> But the pancreas cannot produce unlimited amounts of insulin. At some point, the need for insulin (due to advanced insulin resistance) is higher than what the pancreas can supply. As a consequence, the blood sugar rises beyond healthy levels–even between meals.

> Many factors can contribute to insulin resistance. Certain genetic predispositions can promote its development. Also, lifestyle factors such as a lack of exercise and sleep, and too much stress can lead to insulin resistance. But in most cases, eating habits are driving insulin resistance.

> When cells get overloaded with energy, they try to protect themselves by becoming insulin resistant. And because insulin resistance is accompanied by high levels of the storage hormone insulin, it makes it difficult to access our energy storage. Having no access to our energy storage means that we become hungry very soon after a meal.

> So we eat despite having plenty of stored energy. A simpler way to say this is: overeating causes insulin resistance, and insulin resistance, in turn, causes overeating. It’s a vicious cycle.

> When the liver’s glycogen storage areas are overflowing, it starts to convert glucose into fat. This fat can be stored in fat cells, but their capacity to store fat is also limited. (How much fat fat cells can store is unique to each individual. For this reason, some people gain a lot of weight, while others stay slim despite overeating.)

> The liver has many functions in sugar and fat metabolism. Fat in the liver interferes with these functions. For this reason, fatty liver leads to unhealthy cholesterol levels (high LDL–the “bad” cholesterol and low HDL–the “good” cholesterol), elevated blood lipids, and also indirectly to high blood sugar.

> A fatty liver is reversible in the early stages. But too much fat in the liver leads to scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis of the liver), which is hard to reverse and can even lead to liver failure.

>
> Moreover, insulin resistance leads to the so-called metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome has the following symptoms:
> 
>  - Enlarged waist circumference: >= 102 cm in men and >= 88 cm in women.
>  - High blood pressure: systolic blood pressure >= 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >= 85 mmHg.
>  - Elevated triglycerides (blood lipids): >= 150 mg/dl
>  - Low HDL-cholesterol: < 40 mg/dL in men and < 50 mg/dL in women.
>  - High fasting blood sugar: >= 100 mg/dL
>
> Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when at least three of these symptoms are present.
> 

> Intermittent fasting is very powerful in improving insulin resistance–within a few weeks. Studies show that intermittent fasting can improve all signs of insulin resistance. It: lowers blood pressure, facilitates weight loss (especially in the belly area, improves cholesterol, lowers triglycerides, reduces oxidative stress (a consequence of insulin resistance, improves blood sugar regulation, helps to get the appetite under control.

> Why is intermittent fasting so effective in lowering insulin resistance? By extending the time between meals, you give your body the opportunity to access energy storage areas. Once your stored energy (especially glycogen) gets regularly depleted, insulin resistance improves.

> Intermittent fasting breaks the vicious cycle: increasing the time between meals allows you to access your stored energy --> hunger fades --> insulin resistance improves.

> The downside is that insulin resistance makes fasting more difficult. If you have signs of insulin resistance, you should slowly increase the time between meals when starting with intermittent fasting. For instance, you could start fasting for 12 hours, then proceed to 13 hours, then 14, and so on. Depending on the degree of your insulin resistance, it may take a few weeks or even months before you are able to fast for 16 hours (16/8-fasting).
