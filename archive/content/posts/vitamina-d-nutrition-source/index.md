title: Vitamin D - The Nutrition Source
---

Ontem fui em um exame de rotina e meu médico disse que minha quantidade de vitamina D está levemente abaixo do indicado. Então ele receitou suplementos por seis meses até meu retorno. Perguntei sobre métodos naturais de aumentar a quantidade da vitamina no organismo e ele disse que não funciona ou não é o suficiente ingerir alimentos nem tomar sol. Ele deu o exemplo anedótico de um paciente seu que trabalha todos os dias sob o sol escandante e que revelou a mesma deficiência.

Me dirigi à farmácia mais próxima, no shopping ao lado da clínica, e o valor de uma caixinha para um mês é de 75 reais, o que me parece um absurdo de caro. Desconfiado das afirmações do médico e curioso para entender como que o organismo humano não consegue mais se virar na produção dessa vitamina, coloquei a caixinha de volta na farmácia e resolvi fazer algumas leituras a respeito do assunto.

Li algumas preliminares do Google, aqueles resumos para as pessoas comuns, para me habituar sobre o senso comum, que é que há poucos alimentos que fornecem em quantidades razoáveis essa vitamina, notadamento peixes gordurosos e sua gordura e um ou outro alimento de origem animal para o tipo D3 da vitamina, a mesma que nosso corpo produz com a incidência de raios ultravioletas do tipo B (UVB), e um ou outro alimento de origem vegetal e cogumelos para o tipo D2.

Então fui atrás dos resultados das pesquisas mais proeminentes. Selecionei dois resumos inicias, onde o primeiro texto não me pareceu nada além do que já tinha lido sobre senso comum e este "Vitamin D" do "The Nutrition Source", que me pareceu mais promissor. Ele ordena o tema pelas doenças que a presença de vitamina D previne ou ajuda a combater e cita as pesquisas em torno da questão e seus resultados. Achei curioso que há sempre poréns nas mais diversas afirmações. A sensação é de que o assunto ainda está em franco debate pela academia.

Isso me fez decidir por não ingerir suplementos no momento. Pelo menos até conseguir entender quais as chances disso ser uma real necessidade.

# Recortes

> For most people, the best way to get enough vitamin D is taking a supplement because it is hard to eat enough through food.

> Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 ("ergocalciferol" or pre-vitamin D) and vitamin D3 ("cholecalciferol").

> Both are also naturally occurring forms that are produced in the presence of the sun’s ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays, hence its nickname, "the sunshine vitamin," but D2 is produced in plants and fungi and D3 in animals, including humans.

> RDA: The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults 19 years and older is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily for men and women, and for adults >70 years it is 800 IU (20 mcg) daily.

> UL: The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for vitamin D for adults and children ages 9+ is 4,000 IU (100 mcg).

> Although observational studies see a strong connection with lower rates of certain diseases in populations that live in sunnier climates or have higher serum levels of vitamin D, clinical trials that give people vitamin D supplements to affect a particular disease are still inconclusive.

> A clinical trial that gave women 70+ years of age a once-yearly dosage of vitamin D at 500,000 IU for five years caused a 15% increased risk of falls and a 26% higher fracture risk than women who received a placebo.

> It was speculated that super-saturating the body with a very high dose given infrequently may have actually promoted lower blood levels of the active form of vitamin D that might not have occurred with smaller, more frequent doses.

> JoAnn Manson, MD, DrPH, leader of the main VITAL trial and coauthor of the report on fracture, commented: "We conclude that, in the generally healthy U.S. population of midlife and older adults, vitamin D supplementation doesn’t reduce the risk of fractures or falls. This suggests that only small-to-moderate amounts of vitamin D are needed for bone health and fall prevention, achieved by most community-dwelling adults.

> These findings are consistent with observational data, which suggest that vitamin D may have a stronger effect on cancer progression than for incidence.

> Immune and inflammatory cells that play a role in cardiovascular disease conditions like atherosclerosis are regulated by vitamin D. The vitamin also helps to keep arteries flexible and relaxed, which in turn helps to control high blood pressure.

> Those who had the lowest levels of vitamin D were twice as likely to have a heart attack as men who had the highest levels.

> However, taking vitamin D supplements has not been found to reduce cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of 51 clinical trials did not demonstrate that vitamin D supplementation lowered the risk of heart attack, stroke, or deaths from cardiovascular disease. The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) came to the same conclusion;

> Vitamin D deficiency may negatively affect the biochemical pathways that lead to the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), including impairment of beta cell function in the pancreas, insulin resistance, and inflammation.

> The effect was even stronger when vitamin D was combined with calcium: there was a 33% lower risk of T2DM in women when comparing the highest intakes of calcium and vitamin D from supplements (>1,200 mg, >800 IU daily) with the lowest intakes (<600 mg, 400 IU).

> Notably, among the participants who had the lowest blood levels of vitamin D at the beginning of the study, vitamin D supplementation did reduce risk of diabetes. This is consistent with the important concept that taking additional vitamin D may not benefit those who already have adequate blood levels, but those with initially low blood levels may benefit.

> The rate of multiple sclerosis (MS) is increasing in both developed and developing countries, with an unclear cause.

> Vitamin D was first proposed over 40 years ago as having a role in MS given observations at the time including that rates of MS were much higher far north (or far south) of the equator than in sunnier climates, and that geographic regions with diets high in fish had lower rates of MS.

> Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is another disease that varies with geography—a child in Finland is about 400 times more likely to develop T1D than a child in Venezuela.

> Early evidence suggesting that vitamin D may play a role in T1D comes from a 30-year study that followed more than 10,000 Finnish children from birth: Children who regularly received vitamin D supplements during infancy had a nearly 90% lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes than those who did not receive supplements.

> However, multiple studies examining the association between dietary vitamin D or trials supplementing children at high risk for T1D with vitamin D have produced mixed and inconclusive results

> Children who have vitamin D-deficiency rickets are more likely to get respiratory infections, while children exposed to sunlight seem to have fewer respiratory infections. Adults who have low vitamin D levels are more likely to report having had a recent cough, cold, or upper respiratory tract infection.

> A randomized controlled trial in Japanese school children tested whether taking daily vitamin D supplements would prevent seasonal flu. The trial followed nearly 340 children for four months during the height of the winter flu season. Half of the study participants received pills that contained 1,200 IU of vitamin D; the other half received placebo pills. Researchers found that type A influenza rates in the vitamin D group were about 40% lower than in the placebo group; there was no significant difference in type B influenza rates.

> Although randomized controlled trials exploring the potential of vitamin D to prevent other acute respiratory infections have yielded mixed results, a large meta-analysis of individual participant data indicated that daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation lowers risk of acute respiratory infections.

> Before the advent of antibiotics, sunlight and sun lamps were part of the standard treatment for tuberculosis (TB).

> Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D3. The best sources are the flesh of fatty fish and fish liver oils. Smaller amounts are found in egg yolks, cheese, and beef liver. Certain mushrooms contain some vitamin D2; in addition some commercially sold mushrooms contain higher amounts of D2 due to intentionally being exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet light. Many foods and supplements are fortified with vitamin D like dairy products and cereals.

> Vitamin D2 is made from plants and is found in fortified foods and some supplements. Vitamin D3 is naturally produced in the human body and is found in animal foods.

> A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared the effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on blood levels found that D3 supplements tended to raise blood concentrations of the vitamin more and sustained those levels longer than D2.

> Vitamin D3 can be formed when a chemical reaction occurs in human skin, when a steroid called 7-dehydrocholesterol is broken down by the sun’s UVB light or so-called "tanning" rays. The amount of the vitamin absorbed can vary widely.

> Use of sunscreen; correctly applied sunscreen can reduce vitamin D absorption by more than 90%.

> In the northern hemisphere, people who live in Boston (U.S.), Edmonton (Canada), and Bergen (Norway) can’t make enough vitamin D from the sun for 4, 5, and 6 months out of the year, respectively.

> In the southern hemisphere, residents of Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Cape Town (South Africa) make far less vitamin D from the sun during their winter months (June through August) than they can during their spring and summer months.

> The body stores vitamin D from summer sun exposure, but it must last for many months.

> Vitamin D deficiency may occur from a lack in the diet, poor absorption, or having a metabolic need for higher amounts.

> People who cannot tolerate or do not eat milk, eggs, and fish, such as those with a lactose intolerance or who follow a vegan diet, are at higher risk for a deficiency.

> People who are obese tend to have lower blood vitamin D levels. Vitamin D accumulates in excess fat tissues but is not easily available for use by the body when needed. Higher doses of vitamin D supplementation may be needed to achieve a desirable blood level. Conversely, blood levels of vitamin D rise when obese people lose weight.

> People who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, which typically removes the upper part of the small intestine where vitamin D is absorbed.

> Catching the sun’s rays in a sunny office or driving in a car unfortunately won’t help to obtain vitamin D as window glass completely blocks UVB ultraviolet light.
