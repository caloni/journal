RE: Type referenced: wow64!_TEB32
You can also update the pdb:

 

Define _TEB32 in a file (say teb.h)

 

Cl -c -Fd<fullpath of the ACTUAL wow64.pdb, whatever it is called> -TP teb.h

 

Something like that.

 

You might need to tell .reload to -force the load.

It sounds like that structure is not present in the wow64 module but that's
what's being referenced by the debugger extension.

 

Microsoft would have to fix that if this is the case.  Alternatively, you
could try and see if any other module exports that data type and then
manually decode it yourself.
