UWP processes are always created inside a job (one job per UWP app). This job manages the UWP process and any background processes that execute on its behalf (through nested jobs). The jobs allow the Process State Manager (PSM) to suspend or resume the app or background processing in a single stroke.

This SID is part of the APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY instead of the NT AUTHORITY you’ve mostly seen so far in this chapter. Thus, it begins with S-1-15-2 in its string format, corresponding to SECURITY_APP_PACKAGE_BASE_RID (15) and SECURITY_APP_PACKAGE_BASE_RID (2). Because a SHA-2 hash is 32 bytes, there are a total of eight RIDs (recall that a RID is the size of a 4-byte ULONG) in the remainder of the SID.

One of the biggest side-effects caused by the presence of an AppContainer SID and related flags is that the access check algorithm you saw in the “Access checks” section earlier in this chapter is modified to essentially ignore all regular user and group SIDs that the token may contain, essentially treating them as deny-only SIDs. This means that even though Calculator may be launched by a user John Doe belonging to the Users and Everyone groups, it will fail any access checks that grant access to John Doe’s SID, the Users group SID, or the Everyone group SID. In fact, the only SIDs that are checked during the discretionary access check algorithm will be that of the AppContainer SID, followed by the capability access check algorithm, which will look at any capability SIDs part of the token.

To solve this problem, the security subsystem understands a specific group SID called ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES, which automatically binds itself to any AppContainer token. Many critical system locations, such as %SystemRoot%\System32 and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion, will have this SID as part of their DACL, typically with a read or read-and-execute access mask.

By using the PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES_POLICY process attribute and setting it to PROCESS_CREATION_ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES_OPT_OUT during process creation (see Chapter 3 for more information on process attributes), the token will not be associated with any ACEs that specify the ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES SID, cutting off access to many system resources that would otherwise be accessible. Such tokens can be identified by the presence of a fourth token attribute named WIN://NOALLAPPPKG with an integer value set to 1.

Of course, this takes us back to the same problem: How would such an application even be able to load Ntdll.dll, which is key to any process initialization? Windows 10 version 1607 introduces a new group, called ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES, which takes care of this problem. For example, the System32 directory now also contains this SID, also set to allow read and execute permissions, because loading DLLs in this directory is key even to the most sandboxed process. However, the DNSResolver ALPC port does not, so such an AppContainer would lose access to DNS.

As you’ve just seen, UWP applications have very restricted access rights. So how, for example, is the Microsoft Edge application able to parse the local file system and open PDF files in the user’s Documents folder? Similarly, how can the Music application play MP3 files from the Music directory? Whether done directly through kernel access checks or by brokers (which you’ll see in the next section), the key lies in capability SIDs.

Unlike the first set of capabilities, which map to hard-coded RIDs, these capabilities are implemented in a different fashion. This ensures a list of well-known RIDs doesn’t have to be constantly maintained. Instead, with this mode, capabilities can be fully custom and updated on the fly. To do this, they simply take the capability string, convert it to full upper-case format, and take a SHA-2 hash of the resulting string, much like AppContainer package SIDs are the SHA-2 hash of the package moniker. Again, since SHA-2 hashes are 32 bytes, this results in 8 RIDs for each capability, following the well-known SECURITY_CAPABILITY_BASE_RID (3).

Finally, you’ll notice a few DeviceCapability entries. These refer to device classes that the UWP application will need to access, and can be identified either through well-known strings such as the ones you see above or directly by a GUID that identifies the device class. Rather than using one of the two methods of SID creation already described, this one uses yet a third! For these types of capabilities, the GUID is converted into a binary format and then mapped out into four RIDs (because a GUID is 16 bytes). On the other hand, if a well-known name was specified instead, it must first be converted to a GUID. This is done by looking at the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DeviceAccess\CapabilityMappings registry key, which contains a list of registry keys associated with device capabilities and a list of GUIDs that map to these capabilities. The GUIDs are then converted to a SID as you’ve just seen.

As you may have seen in the earlier experiment, each AppContainer token contains its own package SID encoded as a capability. This can be used by the capability system to specifically lock down access to a particular app through a common security check instead of obtaining and validating the package SID separately.

Finally, many RPC services leverage the RpcClientCapabilityCheck API, which is a helper function that takes care of retrieving the token and requires only the capability string. This function is very commonly used by many of the WinRT-enlightened services and brokers, which utilize RPC to communicate with UWP client applications.

Because AppContainer processes have almost no permissions except for those implicitly granted with capabilities, some common operations cannot be performed directly by the AppContainer and require help. (There are no capabilities for these, as these are too low level to be visible to users in the store, and difficult to manage.) Some examples include selecting files using the common File Open dialog box or printing with a Print dialog box. For these and other similar operations, Windows provides helper processes, called brokers, managed by the system broker process, RuntimeBroker.exe.

Packaged applications do not have a Terminated state. This means that an application does not have a real notion of an Exit or Terminate state and should not try to terminate itself. The actual model for terminating a Packaged application is that first it gets suspended, and then HAM, if required, calls NtTerminateJobObject API on the application’s job object. HAM automatically manages the app lifetime and destroys the process only as needed.

A packaged application can’t distinguish whether it has been suspended or terminated. This allows Windows to automatically restore the previous state of the application even if it has been terminated or if the system has been rebooted. As a result, the packaged application model is completely different from the standard Win32 application model.

The Modern Application Model introduces a new way for storing packaged applications’ settings, package dependencies, and general application data. The State Repository is the new central store that contains all this kind of data and has an important central rule in the management of all modern applications: Every time an application is downloaded from the store, installed, activated, or removed, new data is read or written to the repository.

The modern Start menu uses the changes and events tracking feature of the State Repository to work properly. Every time the ShellExperienceHost process starts, it requests the State Repository to notify its controller (NotificationController.dll) every time a tile is modified, created, or removed. When the user installs or removes a modern application through the Store, the application deployment server executes a DB transaction for inserting or removing the tile. The State Repository, at the end of the transaction, signals an event that wakes up the controller. In this way, the Start menu can modify its appearance almost in real time.

In Windows 10, there are two types of background tasks: ■    In-process background task The application code and its background task run in the same process. From a developer’s point of view, this kind of background task is easier to implement, but it has the big drawback that if a bug hits its code, the entire application crashes. The in-process background task doesn’t support all triggers available for the out-of-process background tasks. ■    Out-of-process background task The application code and its background task run in different processes (the process could run in a different job object, too). This type of background task is more resilient, runs in the backgroundtaskhost.exe host process, and can use all the triggers and the conditions. If a bug hits the background task, this will never kill the entire application. The main drawback is originated from the performance of all the RPC code that needs to be executed for the interprocess communication between different processes.

To provide the best user experience for the user, all background tasks have an execution time limit of 30 seconds total. After 25 seconds, the Background Broker Infrastructure service calls the task’s Cancellation handler (in WinRT, this is called OnCanceled event). When this event happens, the background task still has 5 seconds to completely clean up and exit. Otherwise, the process that contains the Background Task code (which could be BackgroundTaskHost.exe in case of out-of-process tasks; otherwise, it’s the application process) is terminated.

A broker can simply forward events that are generated somewhere else (like in the Windows kernel) or can generates new events based on some other conditions and states. Brokers forward events that they managed through WNF: each broker creates a WNF state name that the background infrastructure subscribes to. In this way, when the broker publishes new state data, the Broker Infrastructure, which is listening, wakes up and forwards the event to its clients.

A user is not able to launch a UWP application by just executing its .exe file (excluding the case of the new AppExecution aliases, created just for this reason. We describe AppExecution aliases later in this chapter). To correctly activate a Modern application, the user needs to click a tile in the modern menu, use a special link file that Explorer is able to parse, or use some other activation points (double-click an application’s document, invoke a special URL, and so on). The ShellExperienceHost process decides which activation performs based on the application type.

The main component that manages this kind of activation is the Activation Manager, which is implemented in ActivationManager.dll and runs in a sihost.exe service because it needs to interact with the user’s desktop. The activation manager strictly cooperates with the View Manager. The modern menu calls into the Activation Manager through RPC.

Before doing this, it needs to set the proper process attributes (like the package full name), ensure that the user has the proper license for launching the application, duplicate the user token, set the low integrity level to the new one, and stamp it with the needed security attributes. (Note that the DcomLaunch service runs under a System account, which has TCB privilege. This kind of token manipulation requires TCB privilege. See Chapter 7 of Part 1 for further details.) At this point, DcomLaunch calls CreateProcessAsUser, passing the package full name through one of the process attributes. This creates a suspended process.

■    The rest of the activation process continues in Kernelbase.dll. The token produced by DcomLaunch is still not an AppContainer but contains the UWP Security attributes. A Special code in the CreateProcessInternal function uses the registry cache of the Dependency Mini Repository to gather the following information about the packaged application: Root Folder, Package State, AppContainer package SID, and list of application’s capabilities. It then verifies that the license has not been tampered with (a feature used extensively by games). At this point, the Dependency Mini Repository file is mapped into the parent process, and the UWP application DLL alternate load path is resolved.

With the goal of enabling the launch of Modern apps (Centennial and UWP) through the command line, starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 1709), the Modern Application Model has introduced the concept of AppExecution aliases. With this new feature, the user can launch Edge or any other modern applications through the console command line. An AppExecution alias is basically a 0-bytes length executable file located in C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps (as shown in Figure 8-46.). The location is added in the system executable search path list (through the PATH environment variable); as a result, to execute a modern application, the user could specify any executable file name located in this folder without the complete path (like in the Run dialog box or in the console command line).

NtCreateUserProcess translates this code to the STATUS_IO_REPARSE_TAG_NOT_HANDLED error and exits.

During token requests and renewal: When a PRT is issued, Azure AD also issues an encrypted session key to the device. It's encrypted with the public transport key (tkpub) generated and sent to Azure AD as part of device registration. This session key can only be decrypted by the private transport key (tkpriv) secured by the TPM. The session key is the Proof-of-Possession (POP) key for any requests sent to Azure AD. The session key is also protected by the TPM and no other OS component can access it. Token requests or PRT renewal requests are securely signed by this session key through the TPM and hence, can't be tampered with. Azure AD invalidates any requests from the device that aren't signed by the corresponding session key.

The python script is asking Azure a nonce for the next request. This nonce is included in the following request so we have to recompute the sha256(RAND24+REQUEST_with_nonce) each time. For now we are still using our C for the key derivation function since IDK how BCryptKeyDerivation do this computation. So for each request we have to provide the SHA256 computed context hash to our C code, recompile it, run it, get the DerivedKey and input it to the python script for the HMAC-SHA256 token request signed part.

ALPC follows a connection and communication model that’s somewhat reminiscent of BSD socket programming. A server first creates a server connection port (NtAlpcCreatePort), whereas a client attempts to connect to it (NtAlpcConnectPort). If the server was in a listening state (by using NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort), it receives a connection request message and can choose to accept it (NtAlpcAcceptConnectPort). In doing so, both the client and server communication ports are created, and each respective endpoint process receives a handle to its communication port.

Therefore, in the simplest scenario, a single server thread sits in a loop calling NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort and receives with connection requests, which it accepts, or messages, which it handles and potentially responds to. The server can differentiate between messages by reading the PORT_HEADER structure, which sits on top of every message and contains a message type.

In all these cases, the server will run in the context of one of the clients that sent a message but may be analyzing a message sent by a different client. The server should distinguish this situation (since the Client ID of the sender is encoded in the PORT_HEADER of the message) and attach/analyze the state of the correct sender (which now has a potential context switch cost).

ALPC provides more than simple message passing; it also enables specific contextual information to be added to each message and have the kernel track the validity, lifetime, and implementation of that information. Users of ALPC can assign their own custom context information as well. Whether it’s system-managed or user-managed, ALPC calls this data attributes.

EXPERIMENT: Dumping a connection port In this experiment, you use the CSRSS API port for Windows processes running in Session 1, which is the typical interactive session for the console user. Whenever a Windows application launches, it connects to CSRSS’s API port in the appropriate session. Start by obtaining a pointer to the connection port with the !object command: Click here to view code image lkd> !object \Sessions\1\Windows\ApiPort Object: ffff898f172b2df0  Type: (ffff898f032f9da0) ALPC Port     ObjectHeader: ffff898f172b2dc0 (new version)     HandleCount: 1  PointerCount: 7898     Directory Object: ffffc704b10d9ce0  Name: ApiPort Dump information on the port object itself with !alpc /p.

First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours. The combination of all these elements causes a sense of deep enjoyment that is so rewarding people feel that expending a great deal of energy is worthwhile simply to be able to feel it."

Mas a verdade é que uma das características de nossa época, uma das fontes ou causas das angústias, conflitos e aflições do nosso tempo parece que está na complexidade, na diversidade e na infidedignidade da comunicação oral ou escrita, quer entre indivíduos quer entre grupos. Sabemos dos mal-entendidos, dos preconceitos, das prevenções, das incompreensões e dos atritos resultantes da incúria da expressão, dos seus sofismas e paralogismos. São as generalizações apressadas, as declarações gratuitas, as indiscriminações, os clichês, os rótulos, os falsos axiomas, a polissemia, a polarização, os falsos juízos, as opiniões discriminatórias, as afirmações puras e simples, carentes de prova... Enfim, linguagem falaciosa, por malícia, quando não por incúria da atividade mental, ou por ignorância dos mais comezinhos princípios da lógica. Esses óbices ou barreiras verbais e mentais impedem ou desfiguram totalmente a comunicação, o entendimento entre os homens e os povos, sendo não raro causa de atritos e conflitos.

In this light, you can see that those upward surges on the mastery curve are by no means the only time anything significant or exciting is happening. Learn- ing generally occurs in stages. A stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task, and the cognitive and effort systems have with- drawn. This means you can perform the task without making a special effort to think of its separate parts.

These subsequent titles include William Powers’s Hamlet’s BlackBerry, John Freeman’s The Tyranny of E-mail, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang’s The Distraction Addiction—all of which agree, more or less, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.

Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early-twentieth-century philosophers. It’s instead a skill that has great value today. There are two reasons for this value. The first has to do with learning. We have an information economy that’s dependent on complex systems that change rapidly.

Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

I shall argue that the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment.

To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot. But these shields are effective only for a while; after a few centuries, sometimes after only a few decades, a religion or belief wears out and no longer provides the spiritual sustenance it once did.

This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment.

They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way.

An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail. This tends to happen whenever a culture has had a run of good luck and for a while seems indeed to have found a way of controlling the forces of nature. At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback. The Romans reached that juncture after several centuries of ruling the Mediterranean, the Chinese were confident of their immutable superiority before the Mongol conquest, and the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards.

The unwarranted sense of security sooner or later results in a rude awakening. When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.

O fundamento e o processo de formação dessa figura (tropo) são os mesmos da metáfora: ambas se baseiam numa relação de similaridade; mas a diferença entre ambas reside ainda no fato de que a catacrese, além de estender o sentido de uma palavra levando-o para fora do seu âmbito estrito e habitual, deixa de ser sentida como metáfora, dado o seu uso corrente.

Quando a metáfora se estereotipa, se vulgariza ou envelhece, acaba como que embotada, perde a sua vivacidade expressiva tal como perde o gume uma faca muito usada. Surge então o clichê metafórico, que caracteriza o estilo vulgar, medíocre, dos principiantes ou dos autores sem imaginação: a estrada serpenteia pela planície, o mar beija a areia, brisa rumorejante, luar prateado, silêncio sepulcral, aurora da vida, flor dos anos, primavera da vida, mais uma página da vida...

“We are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring,” Brynjolfsson and McAfee explain early in their book. “Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.” For many workers, this lag predicts bad news.

The Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, is a particularly good time to have access to capital. To understand why, first recall that bargaining theory, a key component in standard economic thinking, argues that when money is made through the combination of capital investment and labor, the rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the input. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing.

Current economic thinking, as I’ve surveyed, argues that the unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.

neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks. As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner.

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.

Over the endless dark centuries of its evolution, the human nervous system has become so complex that it is now able to affect its own states, making it to a certain extent functionally independent of its genetic blueprint and of the objective environment. A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness.

With this framework in mind, what, then, does it mean to be conscious? It simply means that certain specific conscious events (sensations, feelings, thoughts, intentions) are occurring, and that we are able to direct their course.

Each person allocates his or her limited attention either by focusing it intentionally like a beam of energy—as do E. and R. in the previous examples—or by diffusing it in desultory, random movements.

Attention is like energy in that without it no work can be done, and in doing work it is dissipated. We create ourselves by how we invest this energy. Memories, thoughts, and feelings are all shaped by how we use it. And it is an energy under our control, to do with as we please; hence, attention is our most important tool in the task of improving the quality of experience.

If attention, or psychic energy, is directed by the self, and if the self is the sum of the contents of consciousness and the structure of its goals, and if the contents of consciousness and the goals are the result of different ways of investing attention, then we have a system that is going round and round, with no clear causes or effects. At one point we are saying that the self directs attention, at another, that attention determines the self. In fact, both these statements are true: consciousness is not a strictly linear system, but one in which circular causality obtains. Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it.

One of the main forces that affects consciousness adversely is psychic disorder—that is, information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out. We give this condition many names, depending on how we experience it: pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy. All these varieties of disorder force attention to be diverted to undesirable objects, leaving us no longer free to use it according to our preferences. Psychic energy becomes unwieldy and ineffective.

Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or psychic entropy, a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness. Prolonged experiences of this kind can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals.

When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly. There is no need to worry, no reason to question one’s adequacy. But whenever one does stop to think about oneself, the evidence is encouraging: “You are doing all right.” The positive feedback strengthens the self, and more attention is freed to deal with the outer and the inner environment.

Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex than it had been before. It is by becoming increasingly complex that the self might be said to grow. Complexity is the result of two broad psychological processes: differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies.

A self that is only differentiated—not integrated—may attain great individual accomplishments, but risks being mired in self-centered egotism. By the same token, a person whose self is based exclusively on integration will be connected and secure, but lack autonomous individuality. Only when a person invests equal amounts of psychic energy in these two processes and avoids both selfishness and conformity is the self likely to reflect complexity.
