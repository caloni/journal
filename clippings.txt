UWP processes are always created inside a job (one job per UWP app). This job manages the UWP process and any background processes that execute on its behalf (through nested jobs). The jobs allow the Process State Manager (PSM) to suspend or resume the app or background processing in a single stroke.

This SID is part of the APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY instead of the NT AUTHORITY you’ve mostly seen so far in this chapter. Thus, it begins with S-1-15-2 in its string format, corresponding to SECURITY_APP_PACKAGE_BASE_RID (15) and SECURITY_APP_PACKAGE_BASE_RID (2). Because a SHA-2 hash is 32 bytes, there are a total of eight RIDs (recall that a RID is the size of a 4-byte ULONG) in the remainder of the SID.

One of the biggest side-effects caused by the presence of an AppContainer SID and related flags is that the access check algorithm you saw in the “Access checks” section earlier in this chapter is modified to essentially ignore all regular user and group SIDs that the token may contain, essentially treating them as deny-only SIDs. This means that even though Calculator may be launched by a user John Doe belonging to the Users and Everyone groups, it will fail any access checks that grant access to John Doe’s SID, the Users group SID, or the Everyone group SID. In fact, the only SIDs that are checked during the discretionary access check algorithm will be that of the AppContainer SID, followed by the capability access check algorithm, which will look at any capability SIDs part of the token.

To make matters simple, the only types of securable objects that an AppContainer can access are those that explicitly have an allow ACE for its AppContainer SID or for one of its capabilities. Even unsecured (NULL DACL) objects are out of the game.

To solve this problem, the security subsystem understands a specific group SID called ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES, which automatically binds itself to any AppContainer token. Many critical system locations, such as %SystemRoot%\System32 and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion, will have this SID as part of their DACL, typically with a read or read-and-execute access mask.

By using the PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES_POLICY process attribute and setting it to PROCESS_CREATION_ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES_OPT_OUT during process creation (see Chapter 3 for more information on process attributes), the token will not be associated with any ACEs that specify the ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES SID, cutting off access to many system resources that would otherwise be accessible. Such tokens can be identified by the presence of a fourth token attribute named WIN://NOALLAPPPKG with an integer value set to 1.

Of course, this takes us back to the same problem: How would such an application even be able to load Ntdll.dll, which is key to any process initialization? Windows 10 version 1607 introduces a new group, called ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES, which takes care of this problem. For example, the System32 directory now also contains this SID, also set to allow read and execute permissions, because loading DLLs in this directory is key even to the most sandboxed process. However, the DNSResolver ALPC port does not, so such an AppContainer would lose access to DNS.

As you’ve just seen, UWP applications have very restricted access rights. So how, for example, is the Microsoft Edge application able to parse the local file system and open PDF files in the user’s Documents folder? Similarly, how can the Music application play MP3 files from the Music directory? Whether done directly through kernel access checks or by brokers (which you’ll see in the next section), the key lies in capability SIDs.

Unlike the first set of capabilities, which map to hard-coded RIDs, these capabilities are implemented in a different fashion. This ensures a list of well-known RIDs doesn’t have to be constantly maintained. Instead, with this mode, capabilities can be fully custom and updated on the fly. To do this, they simply take the capability string, convert it to full upper-case format, and take a SHA-2 hash of the resulting string, much like AppContainer package SIDs are the SHA-2 hash of the package moniker. Again, since SHA-2 hashes are 32 bytes, this results in 8 RIDs for each capability, following the well-known SECURITY_CAPABILITY_BASE_RID (3).

Finally, you’ll notice a few DeviceCapability entries. These refer to device classes that the UWP application will need to access, and can be identified either through well-known strings such as the ones you see above or directly by a GUID that identifies the device class. Rather than using one of the two methods of SID creation already described, this one uses yet a third! For these types of capabilities, the GUID is converted into a binary format and then mapped out into four RIDs (because a GUID is 16 bytes). On the other hand, if a well-known name was specified instead, it must first be converted to a GUID. This is done by looking at the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DeviceAccess\CapabilityMappings registry key, which contains a list of registry keys associated with device capabilities and a list of GUIDs that map to these capabilities. The GUIDs are then converted to a SID as you’ve just seen.

As you may have seen in the earlier experiment, each AppContainer token contains its own package SID encoded as a capability. This can be used by the capability system to specifically lock down access to a particular app through a common security check instead of obtaining and validating the package SID separately.

Finally, many RPC services leverage the RpcClientCapabilityCheck API, which is a helper function that takes care of retrieving the token and requires only the capability string. This function is very commonly used by many of the WinRT-enlightened services and brokers, which utilize RPC to communicate with UWP client applications.

Because AppContainer processes have almost no permissions except for those implicitly granted with capabilities, some common operations cannot be performed directly by the AppContainer and require help. (There are no capabilities for these, as these are too low level to be visible to users in the store, and difficult to manage.) Some examples include selecting files using the common File Open dialog box or printing with a Print dialog box. For these and other similar operations, Windows provides helper processes, called brokers, managed by the system broker process, RuntimeBroker.exe.

Windows 10 has unified various components that were interacting with the state of a packaged application in a noncoordinated way. As a result, a brand-new component, called Host Activity Manager (HAM) became the central component and the only one that manages the state of a packaged application and exposes a unified API set to all its clients.

Packaged applications do not have a Terminated state. This means that an application does not have a real notion of an Exit or Terminate state and should not try to terminate itself. The actual model for terminating a Packaged application is that first it gets suspended, and then HAM, if required, calls NtTerminateJobObject API on the application’s job object. HAM automatically manages the app lifetime and destroys the process only as needed.

A packaged application can’t distinguish whether it has been suspended or terminated. This allows Windows to automatically restore the previous state of the application even if it has been terminated or if the system has been rebooted. As a result, the packaged application model is completely different from the standard Win32 application model.

The Modern Application Model introduces a new way for storing packaged applications’ settings, package dependencies, and general application data. The State Repository is the new central store that contains all this kind of data and has an important central rule in the management of all modern applications: Every time an application is downloaded from the store, installed, activated, or removed, new data is read or written to the repository.

All partitions are stored as SQLite databases. Windows compiles its own version of SQLite into the StateRepository.Core.dll library. This library exposes the State Repository Data Access Layer (also known as DAL) APIs that are mainly wrappers to the internal database engine and are called by the State Repository service.

The modern Start menu uses the changes and events tracking feature of the State Repository to work properly. Every time the ShellExperienceHost process starts, it requests the State Repository to notify its controller (NotificationController.dll) every time a tile is modified, created, or removed. When the user installs or removes a modern application through the Store, the application deployment server executes a DB transaction for inserting or removing the tile. The State Repository, at the end of the transaction, signals an event that wakes up the controller. In this way, the Start menu can modify its appearance almost in real time.

The modern Start menu uses the services provided by the AppResolver library to register file system notifications on all the Start menu folders (through the ReadDirectoryChangesW Win32 API). In this way, whenever a new shortcut is created in the monitored folders, the library can get a callback and signal the Start menu to redraw itself.

Unlike from the State Repository, the Dependency Mini Repository does not make use of any database but stores the data in a Microsoft-proprietary binary format that can be accessed by any file system in any security context (even a kernel-mode driver could possibly parse the DMR data). The System Metadata directory, which is represented by a folder named Packages in the State Repository root path, contains a list of subfolders, one for every installed package.

In Windows 10, there are two types of background tasks: In-process background task The application code and its background task run in the same process. From a developer’s point of view, this kind of background task is easier to implement, but it has the big drawback that if a bug hits its code, the entire application crashes. The in-process background task doesn’t support all triggers available for the out-of-process background tasks. Out-of-process background task The application code and its background task run in different processes (the process could run in a different job object, too). This type of background task is more resilient, runs in the backgroundtaskhost.exe host process, and can use all the triggers and the conditions. If a bug hits the background task, this will never kill the entire application. The main drawback is originated from the performance of all the RPC code that needs to be executed for the interprocess communication between different processes.

To provide the best user experience for the user, all background tasks have an execution time limit of 30 seconds total. After 25 seconds, the Background Broker Infrastructure service calls the task’s Cancellation handler (in WinRT, this is called OnCanceled event). When this event happens, the background task still has 5 seconds to completely clean up and exit. Otherwise, the process that contains the Background Task code (which could be BackgroundTaskHost.exe in case of out-of-process tasks; otherwise, it’s the application process) is terminated.

A broker can simply forward events that are generated somewhere else (like in the Windows kernel) or can generates new events based on some other conditions and states. Brokers forward events that they managed through WNF: each broker creates a WNF state name that the background infrastructure subscribes to. In this way, when the broker publishes new state data, the Broker Infrastructure, which is listening, wakes up and forwards the event to its clients.

A user is not able to launch a UWP application by just executing its .exe file (excluding the case of the new AppExecution aliases, created just for this reason. We describe AppExecution aliases later in this chapter). To correctly activate a Modern application, the user needs to click a tile in the modern menu, use a special link file that Explorer is able to parse, or use some other activation points (double-click an application’s document, invoke a special URL, and so on). The ShellExperienceHost process decides which activation performs based on the application type.

Before doing this, it needs to set the proper process attributes (like the package full name), ensure that the user has the proper license for launching the application, duplicate the user token, set the low integrity level to the new one, and stamp it with the needed security attributes. (Note that the DcomLaunch service runs under a System account, which has TCB privilege. This kind of token manipulation requires TCB privilege. See Chapter 7 of Part 1 for further details.) At this point, DcomLaunch calls CreateProcessAsUser, passing the package full name through one of the process attributes. This creates a suspended process.

The rest of the activation process continues in Kernelbase.dll. The token produced by DcomLaunch is still not an AppContainer but contains the UWP Security attributes. A Special code in the CreateProcessInternal function uses the registry cache of the Dependency Mini Repository to gather the following information about the packaged application: Root Folder, Package State, AppContainer package SID, and list of application’s capabilities. It then verifies that the license has not been tampered with (a feature used extensively by games). At this point, the Dependency Mini Repository file is mapped into the parent process, and the UWP application DLL alternate load path is resolved.

The AppContainer token, its object namespace, and symbolic links are created with the BasepCreateLowBox function, which performs the majority of the work in user mode, except for the actual AppContainer token creation, which is performed using the NtCreateLowBoxToken kernel function. We have already covered AppContainer tokens in Chapter 7 of Part 1. The kernel process object is created as usual by using NtCreateUserProcess kernel API. After the CSRSS subsystem has been informed, the BasepPostSuccessAppXExtension function maps the Dependency Mini Repository in the PEB of the child process and unmaps it from the parent process.

With the goal of enabling the launch of Modern apps (Centennial and UWP) through the command line, starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 1709), the Modern Application Model has introduced the concept of AppExecution aliases. With this new feature, the user can launch Edge or any other modern applications through the console command line. An AppExecution alias is basically a 0-bytes length executable file located in C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps (as shown in Figure 8-46.). The location is added in the system executable search path list (through the PATH environment variable); as a result, to execute a modern application, the user could specify any executable file name located in this folder without the complete path (like in the Run dialog box or in the console command line).

NtCreateUserProcess translates this code to the STATUS_IO_REPARSE_TAG_NOT_HANDLED error and exits. The CreateProcess API now knows that the process creation has failed due to an invalid reparse point, so it loads and calls into the ApiSetHost.AppExecutionAlias.dll library, which contains code that parses modern applications’ reparse points.

ALPC follows a connection and communication model that’s somewhat reminiscent of BSD socket programming. A server first creates a server connection port (NtAlpcCreatePort), whereas a client attempts to connect to it (NtAlpcConnectPort). If the server was in a listening state (by using NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort), it receives a connection request message and can choose to accept it (NtAlpcAcceptConnectPort). In doing so, both the client and server communication ports are created, and each respective endpoint process receives a handle to its communication port.

Therefore, in the simplest scenario, a single server thread sits in a loop calling NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort and receives with connection requests, which it accepts, or messages, which it handles and potentially responds to. The server can differentiate between messages by reading the PORT_HEADER structure, which sits on top of every message and contains a message type.

In all these cases, the server will run in the context of one of the clients that sent a message but may be analyzing a message sent by a different client. The server should distinguish this situation (since the Client ID of the sender is encoded in the PORT_HEADER of the message) and attach/analyze the state of the correct sender (which now has a potential context switch cost).

Sabemos dos mal-entendidos, dos preconceitos, das prevenções, das incompreensões e dos atritos resultantes da incúria da expressão, dos seus sofismas e paralogismos. São as generalizações apressadas, as declarações gratuitas, as indiscriminações, os clichês, os rótulos, os falsos axiomas, a polissemia, a polarização, os falsos juízos, as opiniões discriminatórias, as afirmações puras e simples, carentes de prova... Enfim, linguagem falaciosa, por malícia, quando não por incúria da atividade mental, ou por ignorância dos mais comezinhos princípios da lógica. Esses óbices ou barreiras verbais e mentais impedem ou desfiguram totalmente a comunicação, o entendimento entre os homens e os povos, sendo não raro causa de atritos e conflitos.

A stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task, and the cognitive and effort systems have with- drawn.

I shall argue that the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment.

To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot.

This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way.

An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail. This tends to happen whenever a culture has had a run of good luck and for a while seems indeed to have found a way of controlling the forces of nature. At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback. The Romans reached that juncture after several centuries of ruling the Mediterranean, the Chinese were confident of their immutable superiority before the Mongol conquest, and the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards.

The Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, is a particularly good time to have access to capital. To understand why, first recall that bargaining theory, a key component in standard economic thinking, argues that when money is made through the combination of capital investment and labor, the rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the input. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing.

neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks. As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner.

- Highlight Loc. 396-99  | Added on Tuesday, 7 November 23 04:12:21 Greenwich Mean Time

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.

If attention, or psychic energy, is directed by the self, and if the self is the sum of the contents of consciousness and the structure of its goals, and if the contents of consciousness and the goals are the result of different ways of investing attention, then we have a system that is going round and round, with no clear causes or effects. At one point we are saying that the self directs attention, at another, that attention determines the self. In fact, both these statements are true: consciousness is not a strictly linear system, but one in which circular causality obtains. Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it.

One of the main forces that affects consciousness adversely is psychic disorder—that is, information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out. We give this condition many names, depending on how we experience it: pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy.

Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex than it had been before. It is by becoming increasingly complex that the self might be said to grow. Complexity is the result of two broad psychological processes: differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies.

Se nos identificamos com a mente, criamos uma tela opaca de conceitos, rótulos, imagens, palavras, julgamentos e definições que bloqueiam todas as relações verdadeiras. Essa tela se situa entre você e o seu eu interior, entre você e o próximo, entre você e a natureza, entre você e Deus. É essa tela de pensamentos que cria uma ilusão de separação, uma ilusão de que existe você e um “outro” totalmente à parte.

Se for usada corretamente, a mente é um instrumento magnífico. Entretanto, quando a usamos de forma errada, ela se torna destrutiva. Para ser ainda mais preciso, não é você que usa a sua mente de forma errada. Em geral, você simplesmente não usa a mente. É ela que usa você. Essa é a doença. Você acredita que é a sua mente. Eis aí o delírio. O instrumento se apossou de você.

No processo de crescimento, construímos uma imagem mental de nós mesmos, baseada em nosso condicionamento pessoal e cultural. Podemos chamar isso “o fantasma pessoal do ego”. Consiste em uma atividade mental e só pode ser mantido através do pensar constante. A palavra ego tem sentidos diferentes para pessoas diferentes, mas aqui significa um falso eu interior, criado por uma identificação inconsciente com a mente.

To explore the Thinker and the Prover, try the following: 1. Visualize a quarter vividly, and imagine vividly that you are going to find the quarter on the street. Then, look for the quarter every time you take a walk, meanwhile continuing to visualize it. See how long it takes you to find the quarter. 2. Explain the above experiment by the hypothesis of “selective attention” — that is, believe there are lots of lost quarters everywhere and you were bound to find one by continually looking. Go looking for a second quarter. 3. Explain the experiment by the alternative “mystical” hypothesis that “mind controls everything.” Believe that you made the quarter manifest in this universe. Go looking for a second quarter. 4. Compare the time it takes to find the second quarter using the first hypothesis (attention) with the time it takes using the second hypothesis (mind-over-matter). 5. With your own ingenuity, invent similar experiments and each time compare the two theories — “selective attention” (coincidence) vs. “mind controls everything” (psychokinesis). 6. Avoid coming to any strong conclusions prematurely. At the end of a month, re-read this chapter, think it over again, and still postpone coming to any dogmatic conclusion. Believe it possible that you do not know everything yet, and that you might have something still to learn.

Everybody develops routines to fill in the boring gaps of the day, or to bring experience back on an even keel when anxiety threatens. Some people are compulsive doodlers, others chew on things or smoke, smooth their hair, hum a tune, or engage in more esoteric private rituals that have the same purpose: to impose order in consciousness through the performance of patterned action. These are the “microflow” activities that help us negotiate the doldrums of the day. But how enjoyable an activity is depends ultimately on its complexity. The small automatic games woven into the fabric of everyday life help reduce boredom, but add little to the positive quality of experience. For that one needs to face more demanding challenges, and use higher-level skills.

When all a person’s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person’s attention is completely absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over to process any information but what the activity offers. All the attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli. As a result, one of the most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that the activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.

The justification of climbing is climbing, like the justification of poetry is writing; you don’t conquer anything except things in yourself…. The act of writing justifies poetry. Climbing is the same: recognizing that you are a flow. The purpose of the flow is to keep on flowing, not looking for a peak or utopia but staying in the flow. It is not a moving up but a continuous flowing; you move up to keep the flow going. There is no possible reason for climbing except the climbing itself; it is a self-communication.”

A composer of music, for instance, may know that he wishes to write a song, or a flute concerto, but other than that, his goals are usually quite vague. And how does he know whether the notes he is writing down are “right” or “wrong”? The same situation holds true for the artist painting a picture, and for all activities that are creative or open-ended in nature. But these are all exceptions that prove the rule: unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them.

In some creative activities, where goals are not clearly set in advance, a person must develop a strong personal sense of what she intends to do. The artist might not have a visual image of what the finished painting should look like, but when the picture has progressed to a certain point, she should know whether this is what she wanted to achieve or not. And a painter who enjoys painting must have internalized criteria for “good” or “bad” so that after each brush stroke she can say: “Yes, this works; no, this doesn’t.” Without such internal guidelines, it is impossible to experience flow.

To explore the Thinker and the Prover, try the following: 1. Visualize a quarter vividly, and imagine vividly that you are going to find the quarter on the street. Then, look for the quarter every time you take a walk, meanwhile continuing to visualize it. See how long it takes you to find the quarter. 2. Explain the above experiment by the hypothesis of “selective attention” — that is, believe there are lots of lost quarters everywhere and you were bound to find one by continually looking. Go looking for a second quarter. 3. Explain the experiment by the alternative “mystical” hypothesis that “mind controls everything.” Believe that you made the quarter manifest in this universe. Go looking for a second quarter. 4. Compare the time it takes to find the second quarter using the first hypothesis (attention) with the time it takes using the second hypothesis (mind-over-matter). 5. With your own ingenuity, invent similar experiments and each time compare the two theories — “selective attention” (coincidence) vs. “mind controls everything” (psychokinesis). 6. Avoid coming to any strong conclusions prematurely. At the end of a month, re-read this chapter, think it over again, and still postpone coming to any dogmatic conclusion. Believe it possible that you do not know everything yet, and that you might have something still to learn. 7. Convince yourself* (if you are not already convinced) that you are ugly, unattractive and dull. Go to a party in that frame of mind. Observe how people treat you. ~•~ * “Believe” or “convince yourself” – mean to do what an actor does: pretend until the pretense begins to feel real. Or, as Jazz musicians say: “Fake it until you make it.” ~•~ 8. Convince yourself (if you are not already convinced) that you are handsome, irresistible and witty. Go to a party in that frame of mind. Observe how people treat you. 9. This is the hardest of all exercizes and comes in two parts. First, observe closely and dispassionately two dear friends and two relative strangers. Try to figure out what their Thinkers think, and how their Provers methodically set about proving it. Second, apply the same exercize to yourself. If you think you have learned the lessons of these exercizes in less than six months, you haven’t really been working at them. With real work, in six months you should be just beginning to realize how little you know about everything. 10. Believe it possible that you can float off the ground and fly by merely willing it. See what happens. If this exercize proves as disappointing to you as it has to me, try number 11 below, which is never disappointing. 11. Believe that you can exceed all your previous ambitions and hopes in all areas of your life.

Sad as it is to say, you never understand anything by merely reading a book about it. That’s why every science course includes laboratory experiments, and why every consciousness-liberation movement demands practice of yogas, meditations, confrontation techniques, etc. in which the ideas are tested in the laboratory of your own nervous system.

No entanto, o melhor processo para a aquisição de vocabulário é aquele que parte de uma experiência real e não apenas simulada, pois só ela permite assimilar satisfatoriamente conceitos e ideias que traduzam impressões vivas. É inútil ou, pelo menos, improfícuo tentarmos traduzir impressões ou juízos que a experiência, lato sensu, não nos proporcionou.

Aí está, pois — citamos agora textualmente — a importante diferença entre sentido extensional e sentido intensional, a saber: quando as declarações têm sentido intensional, a discussão pode prosseguir indefinidamente, daí resultando conflitos irreconciliáveis. Entre indivíduos, pode provocar a ruptura de laços de amizade; na sociedade, ocasiona a formação de grupos antagônicos; entre as nações, pode agravar tão seriamente as tensões já existentes, que se criam obstáculos à solução pacífica dos desentendimentos (Hayakawa, 1952:59).

For example, if you need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.

What’s important to our purpose is observing that the implications of ART expand beyond the benefits of nature. The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities so long as they provide similar “inherently fascinating stimuli” and freedom from directed concentration. Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run—the types of activities that will fill your time in the evening if you enforce a work shutdown—play the same attention-restoring role as walking in nature. On the other hand, if you keep interrupting your evening to check and respond to e-mail, or put aside a few hours after dinner to catch up on an approaching deadline, you’re robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Even if these work dashes consume only a small amount of time, they prevent you

It is important, however, not to fall into the mechanistic fallacy and expect that, just because a person is objectively involved in a flow activity, she will necessarily have the appropriate experience.

Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos, designed to reduce the impact of randomness on experience. They are adaptive responses, just as feathers are for birds and fur is for mammals. Cultures prescribe norms, evolve goals, build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence. In so doing they must rule out many alternative goals and beliefs, and thereby limit possibilities; but this channeling of attention to a limited set of goals and means is what allows effortless action within self-created boundaries.

It is interesting to note that these two societal obstacles to flow, anomie and alienation, are functionally equivalent to the two personal pathologies, attentional disorders and self-centeredness. At both levels, the individual and the collective, what prevents flow from occurring is either the fragmentation of attentional processes (as in anomie and attentional disorders), or their excessive rigidity (as in alienation and self-centeredness). At the individual level anomie corresponds to anxiety, while alienation corresponds to boredom.

They feel that they are under some obligation—to the subject, to their honor, to the gods of writing—to make their article the last word. It’s a commendable impulse, but there is no last word.

One moral of this story is that you should always collect more material than you will use. Every article is strong in proportion to the surplus of details from which you can choose the few that will serve you best—if you don’t go on gathering facts forever. At some point you must stop researching and start writing.

It’s like the curtain line in a theatrical comedy. We are in the middle of a scene (we think), when suddenly one of the actors says something funny, or outrageous, or epigrammatic, and the lights go out. We are startled to find the scene over, and then delighted by the aptness of how it ended. What delights us is the playwright’s perfect control.

Those who make the most of the potential for enjoyment inherent in music, on the other hand, have strategies for turning the experience into flow. They begin by setting aside specific hours for listening. When the time comes, they deepen concentration by dousing the lights, by sitting in a favorite chair, or by following some other ritual that will focus attention. They plan carefully the selection to be played, and formulate specific goals for the session to come.

The preparation of food has developed in history according to the same principles as all other flow activities. First, people took advantage of the opportunities for action (in this case, the various edible substances in their environment), and as a result of attending carefully they were able to make finer and finer distinctions between the properties of foodstuffs.

The integrated cells and organs that make up the human organism are an instrument that allows us to get in touch with the rest of the universe. The body is like a probe full of sensitive devices that tries to obtain what information it can from the awesome reaches of space. It is through the body that we are related to one another and to the rest of the world. While this connection itself may be quite obvious, what we tend to forget is how enjoyable it can be. Our physical apparatus has evolved so that whenever we use its sensing devices they produce a positive sensation, and the whole organism resonates in harmony.

The second circuit, the emotional-territorial networks of the brain, is concerned entirely with power politics. This “patriotic” circuit is built into all vertebrates and is perhaps 500 million to 1000 million years old. In the modern human it seems to be centralized in the thalamus — the “back brain” or “old brain” and is linked with the voluntary nervous system and the muscles.

One is that critics should like—or, better still, love—the medium they are reviewing. If you think movies are dumb, don’t write about them. The reader deserves a movie buff who will bring along a reservoir of knowledge, passion and prejudice. It’s not necessary for the critic to like every film; criticism is only one person’s opinion. But he should go to every movie wanting to like it. If he is more often disappointed than pleased, it’s because the film has failed to live up to its best possibilities. This is far different from the critic who prides himself on hating everything.

Criticism is a serious intellectual act. It tries to evaluate serious works of art and to place them in the context of what has been done before in that medium or by that artist. This doesn’t mean that critics must limit themselves to work that aims high; they may select some commercial product like Law & Order to make a point about American society and values. But on the whole they don’t want to waste their time on peddlers. They see themselves as scholars, and what interests them is the play of ideas in their field.

How should a good piece of criticism start? You must make an immediate effort to orient your readers to the special world they are about to enter.

Butter contains about 15 to 20 percent water by weight. If butter softens and melts as it’s worked into the dough, its emulsion will break, releasing that water. Water droplets will bind with the flour, developing into long gluten strands that will cause the dough’s delicate layers to stick together.

Gluten development requires water, so this oil barrier significantly inhibits gluten formation, leading to a tender, rather than chewy, texture. As an added bonus, less gluten means more water in the batter, and, ultimately, a moister cake.

Acid keeps vegetables and legumes tougher, longer. Anything containing cellulose or pectin, including legumes, fruits, and vegetables, will cook much more slowly in the presence of acid.

When cooking beans or any legumes, including the chickpeas for hummus, a pinch of baking soda will gently nudge the bean water away from acidity toward alkalinity , ensuring tenderness. And, just like those onions, cook legumes until they are completely tender before adding anything acidic. A great Mexican chef once told me that dousing cooked beans with vinegar or vinaigrette sort of “uncooks” them, tightening and toughening the skins a bit. Account for that tightening when preparing beans for a salad, and cook the beans just a touch longer than you might otherwise.

Acid also encourages bonds between pectin groups—the gelling agent in fruit—so that they can trap water to help set jam or jelly. Some fruits, such as apples and blueberries, don’t contain enough acid to bond the pectin on their own, so we help them along by squeezing some fresh lemon juice into the jam pot and into fruit fillings for pies and cobblers to encourage them to set.

Under normal conditions, strands of egg proteins unravel and tighten when heated. As they do, the strands squeeze out water, causing eggs to toughen and dry out. Acid draws egg proteins together before they can unravel, which inhibits them from joining too closely. A few secret drops of lemon juice will produce creamier, more tender scrambled eggs.

When acid is incorporated into doughs and batters, it will tenderize them, much as fat does. Whether it comes in the form of cultured dairy, natural (nonalkalized) cocoa powder, or vinegar, acid in a dough or a batter will disrupt the gluten network, resulting in a more tender product. If it’s chewiness you’re after, wait as long as possible into the process of dough-making to add acidic ingredients.

Acid tenderizes, then toughens, meat and fish proteins. Imagine protein as coiled strands folded up into bundles. When acid comes into contact with the coils, they unfold and unwind. This process is called denaturation . These denatured proteins then begin to bump into each other and coagulate , reconnecting into an intimate network. The same thing happens when proteins are heated, which is why acid is sometimes said to cook meat or fish.

At first, the intimate network traps water that was previously bound up in muscle fibers, leading to moist, tender food. But if the denaturation conditions persist—that is, if food continues to sit in acid—the protein network will continue to tighten, squeezing water out of the protein altogether, resulting in tough, dry food, much like an overcooked steak.

The other, much slower, method for producing acid in the kitchen is fermentation , where, in addition to many other flavor-producing processes, carbohydrates transform into carbon dioxide and acids or alcohols using yeasts, bacteria, or a combination thereof. Wine, beer, and cider are of course fermented, but so are naturally leavened breads, all sorts of pickles, cured meats, cultured dairy, and even coffee and chocolate.

Remember, the reactions that cause food to brown—caramelization and the Maillard reaction—don’t begin until food reaches much higher temperatures. So, if water is present on the surface of a food, it can’t brown.

While water boils and vaporizes at 212°F, fats can climb to staggering temperatures well beyond that point before turning to smoke. As a result, since water and fat don’t mix, foods containing water (which is practically all foods) won’t dissolve in fat; instead the surfaces of foods exposed to very hot fats can climb to high enough temperatures to develop crisp textures as water evaporates.

The difference between the two methods is minor: braises involve larger pieces of meat—often on the bone—and minimal cooking liquid, while stews are made with smaller pieces of meat cooked with chunky vegetables, typically served together in the plentiful cooking liquid. Greens, dense vegetables, stone fruits, and tofu also lend themselves well to braising.

Think of these long-cooked dishes as opportunities to layer in flavor. Every step of the way, consider how to infuse the most flavor into the dish and extract the deepest flavor out of every individual ingredient. Apply the principles of braising and stewing to any tough cut of meat. To preserve flavor, leave the meat in large pieces and on the bone when possible. And remember to season the meat in advance to let salt do its important work of flavoring from within.

Sweating is a gentle way of cooking vegetables in minimal fat until they are tender and translucent, without resulting in browning. As they cook, they release some liquid, hence the name. Mirepoix , the aromatic combination of onions, carrots, and celery at the root of all French cooking, is typically sweated, rather than sautéed or browned, in an effort to prevent coloring.

To keep temperatures in the sweat zone, watch the pan closely. Add salt to draw water out of the vegetables. Use a pan or pot with tall sides to discourage steam from escaping.

This is exactly the kind of thinking restaurant cooks employ to cut down on the time it takes to prepare a dish to order without compromising quality. Foods that require long exposure to gentle heat—tough meats, dense vegetables, and hearty grains—are entirely or partially cooked in advance and reheated to order.

The situation is not simple. Art derives from human experience, and the artist associates certain actions and motivations with certain cultural and vocational groups because that is how he has observed and experienced them. Would Jews be so fearful of the depiction of Jewish characters as ostentatious and vulgar, aggressive and secretive, if they did not recognize that these elements often converge in “Jewishness”? Would Negroes be so sensitive to the images of sullen bestiality and economic irresponsibility if they did not feel the impact? It is the germ of observed truth that pressure groups fear, a germ which infects only the individual but which the group treats as epidemic. The whole group becomes defensive under the guidance of pressuring leaders who inoculate them with false responsibilities. All these inoculations have produced a real democratic disease: a mass culture made up of stereotypes, models, whitewashes, smiles and lies. To allow the artist to treat his experience freely may be dangerous, but it is a step toward the restoration of individual responsibility. And how else can American indifference and cynicism be cured?

A pena está para o pensamento como a bengala está para o andar. Da mesma maneira que se caminha com mais leveza sem bengala, o pensamento mais pleno se dá sem a pena. Apenas quando uma pessoa começa a ficar velha ela gosta de usar bengala e pena.

Fight Club was not a film I approved of, although I recognized its skill and knew from countless e-mails how strong an impression it made on its admirers. Seeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less. It lacks an intelligent drawing-together of its themes, but that is not held against it in a time when audiences are assaulted with sound and motion, when shots get shorter and movies get louder, when special effects replace or upstage theme and performance. The ability of an audience to enter into the narrative arc of a movie is being lost; do today’s audiences have the patience to wait for Harry Lime in The Third Man?

A assim chamada “abolição da propriedade privada” que ocorreu em meados do século significou, na verdade, a concentração da propriedade em muito menos mãos do que antes; mas com esta diferença: os novos proprietários eram um grupo, em vez de uma massa de indivíduos.

An excellent guide in this respect may be found in the literary construction called the "inverted pyramid." Start at the bottom — the beginning — with the single most important fact, the one the audience must know before learning more. Often this is the conclusion itself.

Naquela tarde, Garganta explicou aos outros bichos, em particular, que Napoleão nunca fora contra a construção do moinho de vento. Pelo contrário, ele é que advogara a ideia desde o início, e o projeto que Bola-de-Neve havia desenhado no assoalho do galpão das incubadoras fora, na realidade, roubado de entre os papéis de Napoleão. O moinho de vento era, na verdade, criação do próprio Napoleão. Por que, então, perguntou alguém, ele falou tanto contra o moinho? Garganta olhou, manhoso. Aí é que estava a esperteza do Camarada Napoleão, disse.

A questão em jogo aqui é muito simples: será que qualquer opinião, por mais impopular — por mais estúpida, até — que seja, tem o direito de ser difundida? Formule-se a questão dessa maneira, e qualquer intelectual inglês se sentirá obrigado a responder que sim. Mas quando ela se reveste de uma forma concreta, e alguém pergunta: “E que tal, por exemplo, um ataque a Stálin? Tem direito de ser difundido?”, a resposta quase sempre será não. Neste caso, o que ocorre é um desafio à ortodoxia corrente, de maneira que o princípio da liberdade de expressão deixa de funcionar. Quando alguém defende a liberdade de expressão e de imprensa, não está reivindicando uma liberdade absoluta. Enquanto existirem sociedades organizadas, sempre deve existir, ou pelo menos sempre haverá de existir, algum grau de censura.

From the point of view of current science, c. 1980-87, there appear to be two things wrong with this Aristotelian mind-set. In the first place, scientific models are not expressed in this metaphor of identity (A is a B) but in the functional language of relationships (When A moves an increment of x in any dimension, B will move an increment of y in some other dimension.) The latter type of functional statement allows for scientific predictions, which can be partially verified or totally refuted by experience and experiment; the former, Aristotelian type of is-ness statement leads only to verbal argument.

METHOD I Step 1. Sit or lie down. Make Faces ~ Stretch all the muscles in the face. Open your mouth as wide as you can, move the jaw from side to side. At the same time open your eyes as wide as you can. Move your eyes up and down and from side to side. This will begin to destroy tension, thereby destroying uncontrolled and extraneous thoughts generated by this area. Make many different faces. Do this for about 2-3 minutes. (A word of caution: While in the end these exercizes are meant to reduce and eliminate certain thought patterns, some might find an increase of new thoughts from previously "Hidden" places of the mind. If this is the case don't be concerned, since this will be a fine way to perform "mental house cleaning.") Step II. Hum and Chatter — Hum from the depths of your voice box. Use OM or just MMMM. Do this for 1-2 minutes. Now using your tongue, chatter — DA DA — BA BA BA. Stick out your jaw as far as you can and continue humming and chattering. Do this for 2-3 minutes. Step III. Shoulders to Ears — Pull your shoulders up as if you were trying to reach your ears. When they start feeling tired, drop them as low as you can. Repeat this 3 times in 2-3 minute intervals. Step IV. Nose Breathing — With your mouth closed take in a deep breath inflating your chest and pulling your stomach up. Be sure to pull the belly in. Hold for a 7 count and then just let the chest fall and the belly relax. Repeat this 10-20 times. Be sure to allow an additional 7 count to elapse before your next inhalation. Step V. Turn Head — Now bring your attention to your head and turn it from side to side as far as you can. Repeat for 2-3 minutes. Undoing Yourself 55 Step VI. Leg Stretch — Lying down on your back, hold your legs about 4 inches off the ground and stretch outward. Hold this as long as you can then let them drop. Repeat this 2-3 times. Step VII. Quick Breath — With your mouth slightly open breathe rapidly, sighing as you exhale. Do this for 2-3 minutes. Now lie down and sense and feel your body, for about 10 minutes. Note every sensation you feel. Now assume a meditative position of your choice making sure that: (1) Your eye lids are not tightly closed, but simply relaxed. (2) That your jaw is relaxed and not tense. Make sure of this by trying to stick out your tongue; if you have to lower your jaw, it was too tightly held. Check your forehead making sure it is not wrinkled. Once you are relaxed, either concentrate on your mantra or point of focus. For those students who do not have a mantra or point, we suggest Dr. Regardie's Mantram tape or simply OOOOO-OOOMMMMMMM. For students who wish or require specific images or points of focus, please feel free to contact us. (3) Finally make sure your throat is not blocked by holding your head in the wrong position. Make sure it is straight. In order to reduce thoughts, keep the eyes relaxed and still, with your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. Do not move the larynx and again be sure that your jaw is relaxed. Meditate before eating, or wait for 2-3 hours after eating a heavy meal. It is also best if the bladder and bowels have been emptied before you start your work.

METHOD II You should have practiced the first stage until you became aware of your deeper tensions. Before starting the second stage be sure your bladder, bowels, and stomach are empty. LIE DOWN ON YOUR BACK Take 10-15 deep breaths starting deep in your guts and work it upward. Try to become aware of all the muscles you use in breathing. When this has been done slowly get up. Stand straight up and count to three. When you reach three let the top part of your body collapse downward at your waist. Do not fall, just let it collapse, do not force it, let gravity pull it down. Repeat this 10-20 times. When you are finished take a few deep breaths and feel the effect this experiment had on you. See if you can sense your pelvic region. Now repeat the same experiment this time exhaling rapidly as you fall and breathing in slowly as you rise. Repeat this 10-20 times and then become aware of the sensations in your body. LIE DOWN ON YOUR BACK Inhale as you do this slowly bring your legs with the knees flexed up to your chest, as you exhale kick your legs out as far and fast as you can. You might want to do this in bed or place some pillows under where your legs will fall. Repeat this until you start feeling tired, then allow your breathing to return to normal. When this happens start again but this time try to hold your legs extended for a second or two before you let them fall. Continue this for a minute or two and then relax again. 79 80 Undoing Yourself Now inhale—on the exhale scream — scream — scream, or if you are a male - yell -yell - yell. Repeat this at least five times. (In order to prevent your friends and neigh- bors from thinking you're nuts and phoning the police I suggest you yell or scream (depending on your sex, of course) into a pillow. Now lie down on your back and sense and feel the energy moving around and through- out your body. Do this for about 5 minutes, and feel the life force move. When you are finished begin your mantram, or if you wish you may use the one recorded by Israel Regardie. If it is used following these experiments it will blow your mind. If you prefer to use your own, record it continually on a tape for at least 20 minutes and then play it back to yourself while you're meditating — Method II is not meant to take the place of Method I, it is just an extension of the experiment. If you are inclined, make a note book or diary of your experiences. There are no-short cuts, so proceed seriously — you can laugh at yourself later — that is unless your laughter begins on its own. When you have completed this experiment try to spend at least ten to fifteen minutes alone. Don't eat or drink, just sense and feel.

METHOD III Again Method III is not meant to take the place of Method I or II, but is a further extension of the technique. This will take a little more time and you shouldn't try this until you have mastered and documented the effects of the other two methods. STAND UP Bend your knees slightly, not too much and let the top part of your body flop forward. Do not force it — just let it drop. While you're in this position, use a five count breath. Five in, hold five, five out, hold five. Repeat this three times and slowly straighten yourself out. Repeat this sequence 08 times or more. When you're done, stand erect for a few moments with your eyes tightly shut. Become aware of any tension in your face, neck or shoulders. Mobilize these tensions by opening your mouth as wide as you can and distorting your face. Now close your mouth and continue on with these distortions. When you've done this for at least 5 minutes, bend your head back on your shoulders as far as you can, and start turning it from side to side. Some people might get nauseous at this point, so be prepared. If by some chance you desire to vomit go right ahead, since the gag reflex is marvelous for reducing deep body tension. GETTING OUT OF YOUR HEAD Sit down again and think about something which you are worried about. Get up again and pace around the room repeating the phrase, "Wh — ats go — ing to hap — pen to me," or some equivalent phrase 107 108 Undoing Yourself which expresses worry. Try not to numb yourself while you are doing this. If you feel silly that's fine, because your worry — ing is silly anyway. Now after five minutes sit down in your chair and think of something joyful. When you have it in mind get up and pace around the room repeating the phrase, "I love it," or some equivalent phrase expressing happiness or joy. When your five minutes are up, imitate laughter as well as you can, then tears, alternating these emotions for at least five minutes. When you are done lie down. Clasp your hands over your chest, pull your knees up and roll yourself up as tight as you can in a ball, tensing every muscle. Hold this position for at least three minutes. Feel your restrictions, now expand, let go of your restriction, let go of everything. As you start to expand let out a shout such as AH! Become aware of your freedom. Repeat this a few times. MEDITATE Choose your mantram, or point of focus, and begin your meditation. SUGGESTIONS There are many ways to use these and the more advanced techniques. Do not become rigid in your experiments — yet remain diligent in your efforts. Some people do better by alternating levels, i.e. use Method I on Monday, II on Wednesday, and III on Saturday, then switch Methods and Days the following week. Others stay with one Method for one month and then switch to others. Be open with your experiments but always remain dedicated to the work. During these periods of experimentation, call yourself by different names, this will help separate the machine you from the emerging Self — the true Scientist of the LAB. If you have any difficulties or questions or wish to find out more information, please feel free to drop me a short note.

Politics and art do seem to be connected for a lot of people, although, of course, it all depends on how you define politics. I think people who try to use art for political purposes generally produce bad art, but again, these things are hard to separate. An artist’s whole feeling about life, and that includes his political views, comes out in the best movies.

Younger movie goers who have watched a lot of television seem to be more passive than previous generations of movie goers. In previous generations kids went to movies once a week. The Saturday afternoon they spent at the movies was the only experience of that kind that they had and they often spent the rest of the week talking about the movie with other kids and they developed critical and emotional responses to it. Kids now watch television and when the program’s over, or even in the middle, they turn to the next one. There’s always more television going on on other channels so they never really talk about what they’ve seen in the same way. It isn’t an intense experience that stays with them and they’re less likely to develop critical reactions.

Television—and TV commercials especially—tends to make people who don’t have anything angry, and it makes them want those things and want them immediately. Television doesn’t point out how hard some of the people who have those things may have struggled to get them.

All art is entertaining, depending on how educated you are. If you’re educated enough, you enjoy Shakespeare; but if you aren’t and don’t have an instinct for it, you may find him tedious work rather than entertainment. There are entertainers who are not artists, but then there are also the pop singers who reach a level where they become artists. But these are just hairsplitting gradations. If art isn’t entertainment then what is it? Punishment?

They think of criticism simply as judgment. They don’t think of it as exploration of themes or performances, or of making connections and flashes of perception and jumping ahead sometimes to see what the director is trying to get at even if he doesn’t get it. It becomes a kind of intuitive process. If I outlined a review, I’d never write it, because the fun for me is discovering the connections as I write.

Perform your energized meditation exercises. Get into your favorite meditative posture and begin to concentrate on your heart Chakra or on Ajna. Watch all the images pass through your mind. When you have achieved true tranquillity, now imagine that you are in a graveyard. Pick up a shovel and dig up a coffin. Open it up and observe yourself inside. See the worms eating your flesh, watch as your flesh falls off. Create images of all the mistakes and errors you made in you life time. Berate yourself over and over again. Do all of this without losing your tranquillity or your concentration. After you have succeeded at this task repeat the first steps. Once you are completely tranquil begin to create images of your enemies humiliating and degrading you. Imagine them torturing you. Image every hideous thing possible. Be sure to remain tranquil and concentrated. The next task is to image yourself doing awful things to others. For some this is more difficult than the first two meditations. Next image yourself having the greatest pleasures and joys this world can offer you. Be sure to remain tranquil and concentrated. Finally image yourself explaining all of this to someone you don't know. Try to convince them of the sanity of this operation.

If everything in the Universe could be known or controlled man would no longer exist as we know him. Thus, to know the nature of a man we simply must ask how he defines both the Numinous and himself and how he lives in relationship to these definitions.

When you have completed your ratings write a short paragraph describing the relationship between man and his God(s). Finally, and most importantly, create your own God (vision of the Numinous) and rate Him or Her. Also rate how this God "sees" you.

The words you think with affect the world you live in.

Real-life experiments conducted by Dr. Lilly suggested that it was possible to "visit" our selves in various states of evolution, but of course physical transformation did not occur. It was the mind which took a ride on a genetic elevator of sorts, allowing re-cognition and realization of the primeval consciousness and/or cosmic consciousness. The point is that we can access the Self beneath the programming and choose to change our minds/ realities, become the meta-programmers of our brains rather than the puppets of the culture we were bread in by applying the magickal formula: Will + Imagination + Altered States.

There are thousands of ways to invoke Eris. You might devote yourself to meditation on the TOWER card, or better yet, draw or paint your own. It helps to get out of your head where all your programs, as well as the potential re-actions to your current programs and future programs exist. Forget the mind; get into your body. Prior to practicing brain-change rituals, prepare yourself and your space by breaking apart "normal" reality. Perform a frenzied Erisian dance, whirling like a crazy dervish until you don't know which way is which, stand on your head for an hour, indulge in extended sexual practice or tantra (prolonged sexual activity is perhaps the simplest and most pleasurable way to alter consciousness), or have sex with an unusual person under unusual circumstances. Throw yourself into an extreme emotional state (terror, devotion, or anger), drum until you become the beat, give your ear to dissonant music, or stare at a cubist painting until you understand it. Hold your breath or try Kriya Yoga techniques. Laugh for the sake of laughter and nothing else (listen to the song "I Love to Laugh" on the Mary Poppins soundtrack for a couple of hours). Talk gibberish or practice Socratic dialectic with yourself. Invoking Eris in your daily life will take some of the tedium out of mundane tasks and greatly speed up your passage into a magickal multiple FUN reality. A good way to start is to break habits and replace them with new ones, then break the new habits Undoing Yourself 201 and replace them, and so on. Or, walk in a different way, talk to strangers, act "out of character" (tell your friends you're performing an experiment), wear clothing which is not your style, explore new routes to work, eat exotic foods, eat on the floor, eat without utensils, write with the hand you don't write with, try to believe in ideas you abhor (except during elections), make love to someone who is not your "type". Really. Sex with "unattractive" partners is said to have been a favored method of self-concept disintegration for at least one notorious brain-change expert. When pleasure is combined with repulsion, two contrary values are married, your judgment is dissolved, and you are lifted beyond duality into oneness. As you give your former "static" reality various Erisian jolts, continuously question your beliefs about the world, your ideas of yourself, your goals and desires. Be brutally "honest" and beg your friends to do the same. Find out where you are and why; you can search your "soul" more effectively than any therapist. What is important is that you recognize the foundations, scaffolds, and walls of your "normal" reality; and demolish them and build anew. To maintain residence in magickal reality keep turning the channel again and again and again. If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards! Evolve! As we become expert brain-change technicians and enter the realm of magick, synchronicities become common occurrences and wishes come true so frequently that one refrains from wishing carelessly. Things just fall into place. We no longer have to put aside time specifically for such practices; instead, we live magickally. Eris provides the necessary dis-orientation and dis-illusionment, both in our rituals and our everyday lives, so we may cast off the shells which separate our essential spark, in all its marvelous and ancient luminosity, from that of everything else in the universe. And so we realize that "All the World's a Stage" and "Every Man and Woman is a Star," thus becoming the directors, producers, and actors of our lives.

By simply cutting out nutrient-poor, ultraprocessed foods that stimulate us to overeat, people will naturally lose weight. Second, when people reduce their overall caloric intake, they will lose weight. But weight loss is not the same as fat loss. Both low-carb and low-fat diets lead to weight loss because they usually also involve restricting calories, but what is important to note is that high-protein diets that are either lower in carbs or low in fat lead to more fat loss. A review published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that the benefits of a high-protein diet were found even when people continued to eat the same amount of calories.

Protein has a high thermic effect on food because it takes more energy to break it down. Interestingly, high-protein diets tend to negate having to count calories. People who followed a high-protein diet and either cut their calorie intake or kept it the same have shown to improve body composition—but people who ate more calories still did not seem to see increased fat mass when those extra calories came from protein. Simply put: increase protein, keeping calories the same, work out, and you will likely lose weight.

Among all the components in meat that have been vilified, perhaps the only one that deserves closer attention is advanced glycation end products (AGEs). There is concern that certain types of cooking result in high levels of them, and that dietary advanced glycation end products (dAGEs) are known to contribute to increased oxidant stress and inflammation.32 The effect of cooking that’s implicated here is also referred to as the browning or Maillard reaction; it is a normal part of cooking but is thought to be problematic in large amounts. Lower-temperature cooking, moist heat, and the use of acids like lemon and vinegar all seem to reduce the formation of AGEs.

Soy milk, which is frequently used as an alternative to cow’s milk, is fortified with calcium, increasing the bioavailability to 75 percent. Although many of these plant foods do contain calcium, the amount absorbed is quite low.6 Nonheme iron comes from plant sources and is not as well absorbed as iron from animal protein, as it is not bound to any protein.

In her book The Vegetarian Myth, Lierre Keith explains how much her body suffered because of eliminating meat. Lierre became vegan at the age of sixteen after learning about the horrors of industrial-scale animal production. She did her research and made sure her diet contained all the right combinations of proteins. She took B12 supplements, and ate lots of fruits and vegetables. Most of the protein in her diet came from soy products. She followed the diet for twenty years. Although she lost her period, suffered from depression, and developed degenerative disc disease that caused morphine-level pain, she explains that she never really drew the connection between her medical problems and her diet. Her pain became absolutely crippling, and her exhaustion unbearable. She went to see a qigong master, whom she heard had “cured the incurable.” He quickly summed up her state and sympathetically told her she must eat some meat. She went to the store, picked up a can of tuna and a plastic fork (because she didn’t want to contaminate her dishes), and ate it. “Oh my god, I thought: this is what it feels like to be alive.

The milk group showed the least improvement on Raven’s Progressive Matrices—a measure of fluid intelligence—even when compared to the children that didn’t receive any additional calories.

In his book Collapse, the anthropologist and historian Jared Diamond writes: Consider a narrow river valley below a high dam, such that if the dam burst, the resulting flood of water would drown people for a considerable distance downstream. When attitude pollsters ask people downstream of the dam how concerned they are about the dam bursting, it’s not surprising that fear of a dam burst is lowest far downstream and increases among residents increasingly close to the dam. Surprisingly, though, after you get just a few miles below the dam, where fear of the dam bursting is found to be highest, concern then falls off to zero as you approach closer to the dam! That is, the people living immediately under the dam, the ones most certain to be drowned in a dam burst, profess unconcern. That’s because of psychological denial: the only way of preserving one’s sanity while looking up every day at the dam is to deny the possibility that it could burst.

The carbon sequestration process starts when the grasses, legumes, and forbs go through photosynthesis. The leaves of these plants take carbon dioxide out of the air and convert that CO2 to oxygen. The plants also exude carbon down through their roots to feed the microbes. This carbon, which is essentially sugar, is known as exudate. Various soil microbes exchange sugar for nutrients like minerals, which the plants need to grow via the root system (known as the rhizosphere). Fungal networks connected to this root system form pathways for the microbes to move through the soil. These fungal networks also produce acids that break down minerals that make the minerals bioavailable to the plants. Minerals have to be made bioavailable for the plants to be able to use them. The increased carbon in the ground changes the structure of the soil, providing more open spaces—kind of like a sponge. Thus, healthy soil is less compact, and can absorb significantly more rainwater than brittle, compacted, plowed, or overgrazed land.

The saying “A chicken in every pot” has been erroneously attributed to 1928 presidential candidate Herbert Hoover. In fact, a group of supporters of Hoover’s political campaign coined this phrase, but the promise was alluring: before the intensification of our food system, there was not extra grain available to raise chickens en masse as is common practice today. The bulk of animal products consumed came from grazing animals, for reasons that are hopefully becoming clearer. Eating chicken today is inextricably linked with modern industrial farming practices that are unsustainable in the long term.

1. If climate change is of concern (and it should be), interventions should reduce net greenhouse gas levels. If possible, the intervention should even present an option for reversing this process. 2. As much as possible, the energy needed to raise our food should come from the sun, not fossil fuel inputs, and our methods should support complex, resilient ecosystems. The exact methods used will have to change around the world—it should come as no surprise that a solution suited to the Mongolian steppe is likely to look different from one suited to the interior of the Amazon—but interventions should be critically assessed with the criterion of energy inputs versus outputs in mind. 3. Recommended dietary practices and food production methods must consider the limited window humanity has with regards to topsoil. There is little debate that should topsoil largely disappear, so shall we. 4. While we are considering biodiversity, it behooves us to also value cultural diversity. The current monocrop industrial food process has effectively crushed traditional food systems, replacing them both at the production and consumption levels with what is arguably a less diverse, less nutritious diet.

Fossil fuels come from “ancient” carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years, and when it is extracted, it’s adding new carbon to the atmosphere, which lasts thousands of years. In the case of cattle, they are transforming existing carbon, in the form of grass and other fibrous materials, into methane as part of their digestive process. Methane is then belched out, and after about ten years is broken back down into water and carbon dioxide molecules. The CO2 and H2O are cycled back to grow more grass, and the cycle continues.

The US currently does not accept beef imports from Brazil, so protesting the burning of the Amazon by not eating beef would do nothing. This is a policy issue, not a cattle issue. See www.sacredcow.info/blog/the-amazon-fires-are-a-policy-issue-not-a-livestock-issue-heres-why.

Additionally, properly managed cattle (and other ruminants) increase benefits of green water by enhancing the ability of the soil to retain water. Interestingly, this is accomplished primarily because there’s more soil carbon in well-managed pastures. The rainwater associates with the carbon and minerals in the soil, making more of it available longer and thus facilitating more grass growth.

In a brittle landscape, rainfall is able to penetrate the top layer of soil only when there is sufficient microbial activity underground. Luckily, cattle and other ruminants can help keep grasslands healthy by biologically breaking down plants, enhancing water retention and carbon sequestration. Their manure is only “waste” when it’s highly concentrated, not when the animals are managed well.

Amid these calculations, we think it should be noted that the nutrition in grass-finished beef is far superior to rice, avocados, walnuts, and sugar. A pound of rice requires about 410 gallons of water to produce. Avocados, walnuts, and sugar have similar water requirements. Globally, 30 percent of groundwater intended for crops is used by rice, followed by wheat (12 percent), cotton (11 percent), and soybeans (3 percent).

Of all antibiotics produced in the US, 80 percent are given to livestock and poultry,13 the majority of which (90 percent) are not sick animals—rather, the antibiotics are intended to marginally improve growth rates and prevent sickness.14 Up to 75 percent of these antibiotics pass through the animal and into the environment unchanged.15 Antibiotic resistance in humans is a massive public health concern, and this is exacerbated, in part, by their broad use in livestock. By contrast, when livestock are given a healthy environment and low stress, they don’t need to be given preemptive antibiotics, which can dramatically cut down the incidence of antibiotic resistance.

Perhaps the most pressing problem for sustainability, regardless of whether we are discussing the potential role of animals in a food system or appropriate measures to address climate change, is that the vast majority of Westernized populations have become divorced from nature. We see nature as a place to visit, not a system we are a part of. Because of this, many people simply can’t come to grips with the idea that death is inevitable, unavoidable, and important for new life. Many think any death is wrong.

British philosopher David Pearce sees the natural world as a terrible place begging for the hand of man to set it right. He sees predatory animals as victimizing their prey, and the scales of justice may only be set right once all predators have either been eliminated or genetically and neurologically reprogrammed to no longer eat other animals. Although his position has not garnered wide support, it illustrates that even the most highly educated among us have become so divorced from the natural world and so afraid of “suffering” that we can be tempted to seriously propose the end of life on earth just to avoid it.

If you want kale, you should be open to the notion that animals should play a role in the food system, and that we may need to eat more animals, not fewer. This scenario means we will maximally capture solar energy in the form of plants, and the animals convert that energy into good soil, fertilizer for other plants, and healthy nutrients for people—in a word, life.

We recognize that this is already a long and technical book, but physicist Jeremy England makes an important point in a recent paper. He argues that the purpose of life is to enhance entropy, or the relative disorder in the world or universe.4 This may be an unsatisfying case for the more spiritually minded, but it has profound implications regardless of one’s religious stance. In the short term, life works against entropy by harnessing the energy around us (mainly from the sun, although a few systems on the ocean floor exist largely independent from this system) and creating more life. This is called a nonequilibrium process (or nonequilibrium thermodynamics, for the technically inclined), and this concept makes the case that we’d do well to foster as much of this nonequilibrium process as we can. What does this mean in practical terms? Encourage as many plants as possible to harness as much sunlight as possible. Have as many animals as possible consuming both plants and animals. Encourage this system to be as diversified and resilient as possible. In short, this looks like a lot of grass and grazing animals; it does not look like row crops as far as the eye can see, all dependent on unsustainable synthetic chemical inputs. If we pause for a moment and imagine an earth without humans, or the earth before humans, both these scenarios involve a remarkable amount of life. And death.

An interesting case study of what happens when meat and fat are replaced with processed foods is that of the native Arctic population called the Yamalo-Nenets. Owing to several changes in their environment and lifestyle, their diets have shifted drastically to include cheap, highly processed carbohydrates like packaged noodles, whereas before they ate few carbohydrates and relied on fat and meat as their primary calorie source. With this change, there have been staggering increases in obesity and chronic diseases never before seen in this population that traditionally ate mostly venison and fish.

In northern Quebec, government officials said they worked closely with the Nunavik to develop a culturally appropriate food guide. One look at the “food igloo” inside the Nunavik Food Guide (written by Canadian dietitians) says so much about how wrong we are. It would be hard to illustrate a more perfect metaphor for the entire nutrition debacle. They’re advised to eat seven to ten servings from the “vegetables, berries, and fruit” group, and this includes orange juice, bananas, watermelon, and grapes. In the guide, Raisin Bran is on the list of recommended grain products to be consumed six to eight times a day. Way up at the top of the food igloo, in the smallest category, are the foods most traditional to their culture—and the guide recommends these be eaten just two to three times a day.5 The Nunavik Inuit Health Survey 2004 shows that approximately 60 percent of the adult population is overweight or obese, which was a sharp increase over the previous survey conducted in 1992. Their intake of traditional foods, obtained by fishing and hunting, declined to only 16 percent of energy intake in 2004, compared to 21 percent in 1992. Iron deficiency anemia affects over half the nonpregnant women in Nunavik. The iron status of women of childbearing age and pregnant women is also considered at a critical level, and this can lead to significant developmental issues with babies. Interestingly, in the guidelines they’re told in one sentence to purchase lean meats like chicken and turkey but then are also told that seal meat (which is definitely not low in fat) is one of the best sources of iron.

As you continue your training, please keep a few things in mind. First, exercise and physical training are meant to make you feel good and improve your quality of life. If you ever find that your quality of health and life are eroding, please stop and reconsider your approach. Fitness habits that compromise your well-being are neither healthy nor productive. Second, listen to your body and trust your instincts. Diet and exercise are far from an exact science; even the leading experts don’t have all of the answers. If you feel that making a change in your approach may be a good idea, then it is worth acting on that instinct. Lastly, know that you’ll learn far more from personal experience than from any book. Resources like this and the others listed in the back of the book (see here ), are great places to get ideas, but the real source of knowledge and understanding is to take massive action. Make your plan and take your first step. Where you go from there is up to you, and I’m sure it’s going to be a fun and rewarding lifelong journey.

Internal pain is a much more serious issue, often showing up in the joints, ligaments, and tendons. You can usually identify tendon pain in the form of a sharp and burning sensation around a joint, especially when the joint is under a load. Tendon pain often occurs in joints that have little muscular support like the knees, elbows, and wrists. Pain in these areas should always be addressed and never “worked through” or ignored. Doing so only leads to a greater degree of internal damage, often requiring more serious measures to address it in the future.

What on earth do sickle cell anemia and malaria have to do with health, weight loss, and food? Let me ask you a question: Is there any moral failing with people who have sickle cell anemia? No, clearly not, at least not due to the genetics which produce that condition. But the same processes that developed sickle cell anemia were at play in wiring our genetics to eat more and move less. You cannot moralize our desire to “eat all the food” any more than one could make a credible argument to lambast folks with sickle cell anemia. When faced with a stress, our species can adapt (like in the case of malaria), but it takes time and the adaptation comes at a cost. If, however, the rate of change is sufficiently rapid, we may not be able to cope effectively. This is the salient point of the discordance theory. Our genes are not identical to those of our hunter-gatherer ancestors; there are changes like sickle cell anemia and lactase persistence (the ability to digest the sugar found in milk), but these changes are incomplete in that some novel foods, like refined carbohydrates, still give us problems.

Calorie restriction or fasting appears to be quite beneficial, as some of our cells can sustain damage over time that induces a state called senescence. In this condition, cells are technically alive, but they are not behaving as they should. Under ideal conditions a cell that becomes damaged will undergo a process called apoptosis and do us the favor of dying and being recycled. In certain circumstances, however, these senescent cells can become cancerous and/or produce large amounts of inflammation, which increases our likelihood of a host of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration.

Ancestral diets that are rich in a wide variety of fibers appear to provide a form of carbohydrate that is not broken down by the action of our digestive enzymes, but instead feeds the bacteria in our large intestine and colon. Bacteria convert certain types of fiber to short-chain fatty acids, which appear to play an important role in feeding the intestinal cells while also decreasing inflammation throughout the body. Additionally, and really to the point of the paper, cellular carbohydrate, like that found in fruits, vegetables, roots, beans, and whole grains are packaged in such a way that their digestion is slow, and this appears to “save” the carbohydrate for digestion later in the digestive tract. By contrast, refined carbohydrate alters the digestive system by encouraging the abnormal growth of bacteria in the small intestine (SIBO), while also encouraging the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the large intestine and colon.

The infant gut is naturally permeable, which allows the large, intact proteins found in breast milk to make their way into the infant body, tuning the immune system and setting us up for success. Early exposure to foods other than breast milk dramatically increases the likelihood of allergies and reactivity to foods, as the highly permeable infant gut is ill prepared to deal with these novel foods.

If we consume more calories than we need, we will tend to gain fat. If we are insulin sensitive, this fat will tend to be evenly distributed around the body. If, however, we are insulin resistant (for whatever reason—lack of sleep, stress, inflammation) and if those excess calories come in the form of refined carbohydrates, this fat tends to be stored around our internal organs and is called visceral fat.

Eating out with friends and family is a nice time to kick your heels up, but it’s easy for this to turn into a “hookers and cocaine” binge versus just having something a bit different than your usual fare. That said, here are some guidelines I’d like you to follow: 1. Stick with the program for at least thirty days. You can do anything for a month—hang in there, get amazing results, then make an informed decision about how tightly you want to run things in the future. You can easily build a meal compliant with the 30-Day Reset at just about any restaurant. 2. I generally recommend that you stay gluten-free both at home and when eating out. Every day there are more and more research articles indicating that this is a smart move for many people. Is it really a terrible prospect to have a chocolate torte or ice cream instead of a pastry? This is all I’m suggesting. Once you get through your thirty days, you can kick your heels up occasionally. But more often than not, go for gluten-free options. 3. If you eat out for most of your meals due to travel or not knowing how to boil water, clearly we need to modify this recommendation. If the former, let’s limit your heel-kick-upping to once per week. If you don’t know how to cook, the Food Matrix is an amazing resource for how to navigate that forgotten room of the house called “The Kitchen.” I think a lack of cooking knowledge, as well as the lack of desire to prioritize cooking at home, is a huge problem, as it tends to leave us earlobe deep in easily accessible, low-quality food. As much as I might finger wag about needing to fix that, I am aware of the social trend toward preparing and eating less food at home. I have spent upward of thirty weeks per year on the road, for years at a time, and all this really boils down to is making better choices. Even when my options are not great, I can make better choices. You can, too.

You will: 1. Start by eating a food with 50g of effective carbohydrate. This is the whole meal. We do not eat other foods at this time, as we just want to track the effects of this singular food. 2. Track your blood glucose response two hours after your meal (just your carbohydrates test food) using your blood glucose monitor. This literally means eat your test food (meal), set a timer for two hours, then take a blood sugar test as per the instructions associated with your glucometer. Ideally, your blood glucose will be between 90 and 115mg/dl at that point. If it is higher than this range, I’d like you to retest that food on a different day at breakfast again, eating 25g of effective carbohydrate (just cut that original 50g portion in half). Retest your blood glucose response two hours after this meal. If it is still above 115mg/dl, then this particular food is likely not a good fit for you.

Given that you may be retesting a few (or several) foods, this may in fact be longer than a seven-day test, but within that time span you should have a better idea of the carbs that work for you. This process will let you know precisely how you respond to various foods and will allow you to find a per-meal carb load that works for you.

It’s probable that once you have improved your gut health by sticking mainly with more favorable foods for three to six months, you may be able to better tolerate problematic foods.

My response to the people in this camp is this: you can have two meals per week to do with pretty much what you want. In theory we should be eating roughly twenty-one meals per week, so two meals make up 10 percent (well, technically 9.52 percent, but who’s counting, right?) of that, which means you are sticking to the plan about 90 percent of the time. As always, here are my caveats to this: I generally recommend that you stick to gluten-free options. If you are convinced gluten is not a problem for you, then by all means, include it, but as I’ve said many times in this book, I’m shocked by how many people do better without gluten. Know yourself. If this off-the-rails eating takes on the appearance of a college drinking binge in Tijuana, this is likely not a good option. You need to decide if the cost-benefit ratio is worth it to you. If you turn these events into the equivalent of the Kitchen Sink Challenge I described early in the book, consuming 8 pounds of ice cream in a sitting, we have a problem. I am not advocating that.

Not every day was a success with regard to hunting or gathering. Because our brains are so large and metabolically active (only about 2 percent of our weight yet nearly 20 percent of our energy usage), food scarcity could pose a serious problem for our cognitive abilities, arguably the greatest asset humans have relative to other animals. If the brain can only run on glucose (as most health care providers claim), we must have a consistent supply of dietary glucose or we will “bonk” (experience serious cognitive problems due to low blood sugar) and cannibalize the proteins in our body to produce glucose for the brain, a process called gluconeogenesis. Fortunately for us, biology figured out an elegant solution to the problem of inconsistent food sources and a large, hungry brain in the form of ketosis.

Without sufficient glucose (or protein) to catalyze the metabolism of fats, we shift to a different process, ketosis, which solves several problems simultaneously. Ketosis takes the high-energy fat molecules stored in our bodies and converts them to a form that can fuel the heart, muscles, organs, and, perhaps most important, the brain. This provides an almost limitless supply of brain-friendly fuel in the form of ketones, while decreasing the need for our metabolism to use our muscles and internal organs to produce glucose.

Ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) are water soluble, which is why they are so effective at fueling the brain: they easily pass the blood-brain barrier. Entering ketosis under starvation conditions dramatically slows the loss of muscle and organ mass as the bulk of our energy requirements are met by converting our abundant fat stores into easily metabolized ketones. Additionally, we do not see cognitive impairment as the brain easily shifts to ketone use and this protects the brain from the ups and downs associated with a carb/glucose dependent metabolism. Many people (but not all!) experimenting with ketosis notice that cognition is “fantastic”

Ketones provide an alternate fuel for the brain and body while making small amounts of glucose from the glycerol backbone of triglycerides (fats). Ketosis also offers an amazing benefit in that it encourages our bodies to evaluate if the cells and proteins in our cells are healthy. Ketosis causes a low-grade stress (hormesis), which causes damaged or sick cells to die via a process called apoptosis. The constituents of these cells get recycled instead of becoming diseased. This helps us in two ways: it provides raw materials to help us during scarcity, and it eliminates damaged cells that have a high likelihood of becoming cancerous or diseased. Much of what we perceive to be aging appears to be an accumulation of damaged cells and cellular components. Intermittent ketosis, either by fasting or nutritional ketosis (a high-fat, low-carb, moderate-protein diet) appears to be an effective strategy to address this problem and may offer profound antiaging benefits.
==========

Chapter Fourteen: Hammers, Drills, and Ketosis: The Best Tool Your Doctor May Never Use > Page 223

Another common feature of aging is a loss of mitochondria, which can negatively impact our metabolism and may be a common problem in diseases ranging from cancer to autoimmunity to neurodegenerative disease. I don’t want to get too far into the weeds on this, but one of the benefits of ketosis is that it dramatically increases the mitochondrial density of our muscles and organs. More mitochondria means more energy.
==========

Chapter Fourteen: Hammers, Drills, and Ketosis: The Best Tool Your Doctor May Never Use > Page 225

While eating normal mixed meals, we tend to see virtually no ketone production. After an overnight fast, we see a small amount. Under the state of nutritional ketosis, we tend to see a range of 1 to 3, while an extended fast can produce ketone levels as high as 7 to 10. Ketoacidosis, by contrast, produces levels that are much higher than either fasting or nutritional ketosis. The medical community recognizes that blood glucose has healthy and unhealthy ranges, yet there is not the same awareness around ketone levels. Ketoacidosis is most common in poorly controlled diabetes cases, in which insulin usages does not match carbohydrate intake. This can dangerously shift the blood pH, leading to coma and possibly death. So I do not want to make light of the concerns medical professionals have on this topic, but it’s also time for them to not just “get through” their biochemistry, but to actually remember it. It is as unreasonable to equate ketoacidosis with fasting and nutritional ketosis as it is to somehow link normal blood glucose levels (in an insulin sensitive individual) with diabetes. Ketoacidosis is too many ketones; diabetes is too much blood glucose.

Although still a fringe research area, information about the ketogenic diet has exploded in recent years due to academic interest, but I must make the point: this interest was inspired by grassroots activism on the Internet. When researchers really began looking at the mechanisms of the ketogenic diet, they found that this way of eating: 1. Dramatically reduced insulin levels 2. Reduced and normalized blood glucose levels 3. Provided an alternate fuel for the brain (ketone bodies) 4. Stabilized electrical activity in the brain 5. Reduced inflammation
==========

Chapter Fourteen: Hammers, Drills, and Ketosis: The Best Tool Your Doctor May Never Use > Page 227

By understanding these mechanisms, researchers also began looking at a number of other conditions that might benefit from the ketogenic diet, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and diabetes.

In the 1920s, Otto Warburg observed that certain types of cancers shifted to a metabolism built exclusively from glucose fermentation. This is in stark contrast to most normal cells, which use the mitochondria to metabolize protein, carbs, and fat in a process called cellular respiration. It was theorized that mitochondrial dysfunction was the root of most cancers. This theory held sway until the characterization of the DNA double helix in the 1950s. At this time the metabolic theory of cancer fell out of vogue and we have spent the past seventy years looking at and treating cancer from a genetic rather than metabolic perspective.

There have been a few small studies in which individuals suffering from neurodegenerative disease were fed a low-glycemic-load diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). MCTs are interesting in that we tend to metabolize them preferentially and the result is an appreciable increase in blood ketone levels. This protocol has proven beneficial for certain neurodegenerative diseases, and research in this area is really ramping up. Additional tools that may prove helpful include ketone salts and esters. These substances can produce ketone levels that are quite high and simply need to be mixed with water to be consumed. While these are by no means cure-alls, they are nonetheless exciting opportunities for those suffering from these diseases.

There is clearly a deeper story here that no one has the answer to, but if your blood work shifts toward higher LDL-P while in ketosis yet normalizes on 100 to 150g of carbs per day, I think it’s safe to say the latter path is better for you.

Type-B artists reported in their interviews that by the time the drawing was well advanced, it took on a life of its own: the artist was solving a problem that had no known precedent, a problem that emerged out of the process itself. In other words, they were like Einstein’s detective who had to commit his own crime before solving it.

Bertrand Russell registrou quase a mesma ideia em sua obra de caráter muito pessoal A conquista da felicidade. Ele escreveu que o esforço, ainda mais que o sucesso, é um ingrediente essencial da felicidade; uma pessoa que é capaz de satisfazer todos os seus caprichos sem esforço considera que a realização dos desejos não contribui para a felicidade. Um foco sobre o eu é uma causa de infelicidade, ao passo que a alegria vem de direcionar nossos interesses para fora, jogando-nos para dentro da vida.

Em Investigações filosóficas, Wittgenstein admitiu que tinha se equivocado na visão expressa anteriormente em seu Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus de que a linguagem é um meio de descrever o mundo. As palavras não apenas nomeiam as coisas; muitas vezes elas transmitem um significado elaborado, e muitos significados diferentes a partir da mesma palavra. A linguagem não é uma lógica formal que marca os limites de nosso mundo, mas um jogo social em que a ordem do jogo é livre e evolui.

Fortunately, modern processors are so fast and memories so capacious that it’s usually fine to start with the simplest code possible rather than trying to save time or space. Certainly this is the case when you’re evolving a program: simple first, faster but more complicated later but only if necessary.

Tukey invented a number of basic data visualization techniques like boxplots, inspired the statistical programming language S that led to the widely-used R language, co-invented the Fast Fourier Transform, and coined the words “bit” and “software.” The authors knew John Tukey as a friend and colleague at Bell Labs in the 1970s and 1980s, where among a large number of very smart and creative people, he stood out as someone special.

This may or may not be statistically significant, but the average rating of high-alcohol beers is higher than the overall average rating, which in turn is higher than low-alcohol beers. (This is consistent with the personal preferences of at least one of the authors.)

The moral of these examples is that one has to look at all the data carefully. How many fields are empty or have an explicitly non-useful value like “N/A”? What is the range of values in a column? What are the distinct values? Answering such questions should be part of the initial exploration, and creating some simple scripts to automate the process can be a good investment.

As John Tukey said, The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data. Be approximately right rather than exactly wrong.

By the way, as a historical note, one of the inspirations for Awk was an error-checking tool created by Marc Rochkind at Bell Labs in the mid 1970s. Marc’s program, written in C, took a sequence of regular expressions as input and created a C program that would scan its input and report any line that matched any of the patterns. It was a very neat idea, and we stole it unabashedly.

A newline character is always a field separator for multiline records, regardless of the value of FS. When RS is set to "", the field separator by default is any sequence of spaces and tabs, or newline. When FS is set to \n, only a newline acts as a field separator.

The conversion is done by passing the document through two programs. This division of labor is another instance of a powerful general technique: the first program creates a second program to do the rest of the job; it’s a program that writes a program.

A KWIC or permuted index can be useful for detecting anomalies in writing, like spelling errors, because the process brings together words that share a common prefix but may differ later. A variation that works on columns in a dataset will have the same desirable properties.

A major document like a book or a manual usually needs an index. There are three parts to indexing. The first is deciding on the terms to be indexed; this is demanding intellectual work if done well, and is hard to mechanize. The second is to insert indexing terms in the text that will capture page numbers as the text is formatted. The third part really is mechanical: producing, from a list of index terms and page numbers, a properly alphabetized and formatted index, like the one at the back of this book.

Awk is useful for creating processors for experimental languages because its basic operations support many of the tasks involved in language translation. Simple syntax analysis can be handled with field splitting and regular expression pattern matching. Symbol tables can be managed with associative arrays. Code generation can be done with printf statements.

We were surprised at how rapidly Awk became popular as a general-purpose programming language; our first reaction to a program that didn’t fit on one page was shock and amazement. What had happened was that many people restricted their use of the computer to the shell (the command language) and to Awk. Rather than writing in a “real” programming language, they were stretching the tools they found convenient.

Binary search requires that we have fast access to two elements—specifically the median elements above and below the given node. To combine these ideas, we need a “linked list” with two pointers per node. This is the basic idea behind binary search trees.

But what of a to-be-deleted node with two children? Our solution is to relabel this node with the key of its immediate successor in sorted order. This successor must be the smallest value in the right subtree, specifically the leftmost descendant in the right subtree (p). Moving this to the point of deletion results in a properly-labeled binary search tree, and reduces our deletion problem to physically removing a node with at most one child—

Unfortunately, bad things can happen when building trees through insertion. The data structure has no control over the order of insertion. Consider what happens if the user inserts the keys in sorted order. The operations insert(a), followed by insert(b), insert(c), insert(d),…will produce a skinny linear height tree where only right pointers are used.
