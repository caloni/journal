UWP processes are always created inside a job (one job per UWP app). This job manages the UWP process and any background processes that execute on its behalf (through nested jobs). The jobs allow the Process State Manager (PSM) to suspend or resume the app or background processing in a single stroke.

This SID is part of the APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY instead of the NT AUTHORITY you’ve mostly seen so far in this chapter. Thus, it begins with S-1-15-2 in its string format, corresponding to SECURITY_APP_PACKAGE_BASE_RID (15) and SECURITY_APP_PACKAGE_BASE_RID (2). Because a SHA-2 hash is 32 bytes, there are a total of eight RIDs (recall that a RID is the size of a 4-byte ULONG) in the remainder of the SID.

One of the biggest side-effects caused by the presence of an AppContainer SID and related flags is that the access check algorithm you saw in the “Access checks” section earlier in this chapter is modified to essentially ignore all regular user and group SIDs that the token may contain, essentially treating them as deny-only SIDs. This means that even though Calculator may be launched by a user John Doe belonging to the Users and Everyone groups, it will fail any access checks that grant access to John Doe’s SID, the Users group SID, or the Everyone group SID. In fact, the only SIDs that are checked during the discretionary access check algorithm will be that of the AppContainer SID, followed by the capability access check algorithm, which will look at any capability SIDs part of the token.

To solve this problem, the security subsystem understands a specific group SID called ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES, which automatically binds itself to any AppContainer token. Many critical system locations, such as %SystemRoot%\System32 and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion, will have this SID as part of their DACL, typically with a read or read-and-execute access mask.

By using the PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES_POLICY process attribute and setting it to PROCESS_CREATION_ALL_APPLICATION_PACKAGES_OPT_OUT during process creation (see Chapter 3 for more information on process attributes), the token will not be associated with any ACEs that specify the ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES SID, cutting off access to many system resources that would otherwise be accessible. Such tokens can be identified by the presence of a fourth token attribute named WIN://NOALLAPPPKG with an integer value set to 1.

Of course, this takes us back to the same problem: How would such an application even be able to load Ntdll.dll, which is key to any process initialization? Windows 10 version 1607 introduces a new group, called ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES, which takes care of this problem. For example, the System32 directory now also contains this SID, also set to allow read and execute permissions, because loading DLLs in this directory is key even to the most sandboxed process. However, the DNSResolver ALPC port does not, so such an AppContainer would lose access to DNS.

As you’ve just seen, UWP applications have very restricted access rights. So how, for example, is the Microsoft Edge application able to parse the local file system and open PDF files in the user’s Documents folder? Similarly, how can the Music application play MP3 files from the Music directory? Whether done directly through kernel access checks or by brokers (which you’ll see in the next section), the key lies in capability SIDs.

Unlike the first set of capabilities, which map to hard-coded RIDs, these capabilities are implemented in a different fashion. This ensures a list of well-known RIDs doesn’t have to be constantly maintained. Instead, with this mode, capabilities can be fully custom and updated on the fly. To do this, they simply take the capability string, convert it to full upper-case format, and take a SHA-2 hash of the resulting string, much like AppContainer package SIDs are the SHA-2 hash of the package moniker. Again, since SHA-2 hashes are 32 bytes, this results in 8 RIDs for each capability, following the well-known SECURITY_CAPABILITY_BASE_RID (3).

Finally, you’ll notice a few DeviceCapability entries. These refer to device classes that the UWP application will need to access, and can be identified either through well-known strings such as the ones you see above or directly by a GUID that identifies the device class. Rather than using one of the two methods of SID creation already described, this one uses yet a third! For these types of capabilities, the GUID is converted into a binary format and then mapped out into four RIDs (because a GUID is 16 bytes). On the other hand, if a well-known name was specified instead, it must first be converted to a GUID. This is done by looking at the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DeviceAccess\CapabilityMappings registry key, which contains a list of registry keys associated with device capabilities and a list of GUIDs that map to these capabilities. The GUIDs are then converted to a SID as you’ve just seen.

As you may have seen in the earlier experiment, each AppContainer token contains its own package SID encoded as a capability. This can be used by the capability system to specifically lock down access to a particular app through a common security check instead of obtaining and validating the package SID separately.

Finally, many RPC services leverage the RpcClientCapabilityCheck API, which is a helper function that takes care of retrieving the token and requires only the capability string. This function is very commonly used by many of the WinRT-enlightened services and brokers, which utilize RPC to communicate with UWP client applications.

Because AppContainer processes have almost no permissions except for those implicitly granted with capabilities, some common operations cannot be performed directly by the AppContainer and require help. (There are no capabilities for these, as these are too low level to be visible to users in the store, and difficult to manage.) Some examples include selecting files using the common File Open dialog box or printing with a Print dialog box. For these and other similar operations, Windows provides helper processes, called brokers, managed by the system broker process, RuntimeBroker.exe.

Windows 10 has unified various components that were interacting with the state of a packaged application in a noncoordinated way.

Packaged applications do not have a Terminated state. This means that an application does not have a real notion of an Exit or Terminate state and should not try to terminate itself. The actual model for terminating a Packaged application is that first it gets suspended, and then HAM, if required, calls NtTerminateJobObject API on the application’s job object. HAM automatically manages the app lifetime and destroys the process only as needed.

A packaged application can’t distinguish whether it has been suspended or terminated. This allows Windows to automatically restore the previous state of the application even if it has been terminated or if the system has been rebooted. As a result, the packaged application model is completely different from the standard Win32 application model.

The Modern Application Model introduces a new way for storing packaged applications’ settings, package dependencies, and general application data. The State Repository is the new central store that contains all this kind of data and has an important central rule in the management of all modern applications: Every time an application is downloaded from the store, installed, activated, or removed, new data is read or written to the repository.

The modern Start menu uses the changes and events tracking feature of the State Repository to work properly. Every time the ShellExperienceHost process starts, it requests the State Repository to notify its controller (NotificationController.dll) every time a tile is modified, created, or removed. When the user installs or removes a modern application through the Store, the application deployment server executes a DB transaction for inserting or removing the tile. The State Repository, at the end of the transaction, signals an event that wakes up the controller. In this way, the Start menu can modify its appearance almost in real time.

In Windows 10, there are two types of background tasks: In-process background task The application code and its background task run in the same process. From a developer’s point of view, this kind of background task is easier to implement, but it has the big drawback that if a bug hits its code, the entire application crashes. The in-process background task doesn’t support all triggers available for the out-of-process background tasks. Out-of-process background task The application code and its background task run in different processes (the process could run in a different job object, too). This type of background task is more resilient, runs in the backgroundtaskhost.exe host process, and can use all the triggers and the conditions. If a bug hits the background task, this will never kill the entire application. The main drawback is originated from the performance of all the RPC code that needs to be executed for the interprocess communication between different processes.

To provide the best user experience for the user, all background tasks have an execution time limit of 30 seconds total. After 25 seconds, the Background Broker Infrastructure service calls the task’s Cancellation handler (in WinRT, this is called OnCanceled event). When this event happens, the background task still has 5 seconds to completely clean up and exit. Otherwise, the process that contains the Background Task code (which could be BackgroundTaskHost.exe in case of out-of-process tasks; otherwise, it’s the application process) is terminated.

A broker can simply forward events that are generated somewhere else (like in the Windows kernel) or can generates new events based on some other conditions and states. Brokers forward events that they managed through WNF: each broker creates a WNF state name that the background infrastructure subscribes to. In this way, when the broker publishes new state data, the Broker Infrastructure, which is listening, wakes up and forwards the event to its clients.

A user is not able to launch a UWP application by just executing its .exe file (excluding the case of the new AppExecution aliases, created just for this reason. We describe AppExecution aliases later in this chapter). To correctly activate a Modern application, the user needs to click a tile in the modern menu, use a special link file that Explorer is able to parse, or use some other activation points (double-click an application’s document, invoke a special URL, and so on).

Before doing this, it needs to set the proper process attributes (like the package full name), ensure that the user has the proper license for launching the application, duplicate the user token, set the low integrity level to the new one, and stamp it with the needed security attributes. (Note that the DcomLaunch service runs under a System account, which has TCB privilege. This kind of token manipulation requires TCB privilege. See Chapter 7 of Part 1 for further details.) At this point, DcomLaunch calls CreateProcessAsUser, passing the package full name through one of the process attributes. This creates a suspended process.

The rest of the activation process continues in Kernelbase.dll. The token produced by DcomLaunch is still not an AppContainer but contains the UWP Security attributes. A Special code in the CreateProcessInternal function uses the registry cache of the Dependency Mini Repository to gather the following information about the packaged application: Root Folder, Package State, AppContainer package SID, and list of application’s capabilities. It then verifies that the license has not been tampered with (a feature used extensively by games). At this point, the Dependency Mini Repository file is mapped into the parent process, and the UWP application DLL alternate load path is resolved.

The AppContainer token, its object namespace, and symbolic links are created with the BasepCreateLowBox function, which performs the majority of the work in user mode, except for the actual AppContainer token creation, which is performed using the NtCreateLowBoxToken kernel function. We have already covered AppContainer tokens in Chapter 7 of Part 1. The kernel process object is created as usual by using NtCreateUserProcess kernel API. After the CSRSS subsystem has been informed, the BasepPostSuccessAppXExtension function maps the Dependency Mini Repository in the PEB of the child process and unmaps it from the parent process. The new process can then be finally started by resuming its main thread.

With the goal of enabling the launch of Modern apps (Centennial and UWP) through the command line, starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 1709), the Modern Application Model has introduced the concept of AppExecution aliases. With this new feature, the user can launch Edge or any other modern applications through the console command line. An AppExecution alias is basically a 0-bytes length executable file located in C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps (as shown in Figure 8-46.). The location is added in the system executable search path list (through the PATH environment variable); as a result, to execute a modern application, the user could specify any executable file name located in this folder without the complete path (like in the Run dialog box or in the console command line).

NtCreateUserProcess translates this code to the STATUS_IO_REPARSE_TAG_NOT_HANDLED error and exits. The CreateProcess API now knows that the process creation has failed due to an invalid reparse point, so it loads and calls into the ApiSetHost.AppExecutionAlias.dll library, which contains code that parses modern applications’ reparse points.

ALPC follows a connection and communication model that’s somewhat reminiscent of BSD socket programming. A server first creates a server connection port (NtAlpcCreatePort), whereas a client attempts to connect to it (NtAlpcConnectPort). If the server was in a listening state (by using NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort), it receives a connection request message and can choose to accept it (NtAlpcAcceptConnectPort). In doing so, both the client and server communication ports are created, and each respective endpoint process receives a handle to its communication port.

Therefore, in the simplest scenario, a single server thread sits in a loop calling NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort and receives with connection requests, which it accepts, or messages, which it handles and potentially responds to. The server can differentiate between messages by reading the PORT_HEADER structure, which sits on top of every message and contains a message type.

In all these cases, the server will run in the context of one of the clients that sent a message but may be analyzing a message sent by a different client. The server should distinguish this situation (since the Client ID of the sender is encoded in the PORT_HEADER of the message) and attach/analyze the state of the correct sender (which now has a potential context switch cost).

ALPC provides more than simple message passing; it also enables specific contextual information to be added to each message and have the kernel track the validity, lifetime, and implementation of that information. Users of ALPC can assign their own custom context information as well. Whether it’s system-managed or user-managed, ALPC calls this data attributes.

"Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or psychic entropy, a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness. Prolonged experiences of this kind can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals."

First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours. The combination of all these elements causes a sense of deep enjoyment that is so rewarding people feel that expending a great deal of energy is worthwhile simply to be able to feel it."

being able to forget temporarily who we are seems to be very enjoyable. When not preoccupied with our selves, we actually have a chance to expand the concept of who we are. Loss of self-consciousness can lead to self-transcendence, to a feeling that the boundaries of our being have been pushed forward."

"Even the simplest physical act becomes enjoyable when it is transformed so as to produce flow. The essential steps in this process are: (a) to set an overall goal, and as many subgoals as are realistically feasible; (b) to find ways of measuring progress in terms of the goals chosen; (c) to keep concentrating on what one is doing, and to keep making finer and finer distinctions in the challenges involved in the activity; (d) to develop the skills necessary to interact with the opportunities available; and (e) to keep raising the stakes if the activity becomes boring."

People were happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby; all of these activities require few material resources, but they demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy. Leisure that uses up external resources, however, often requires less attention, and as a consequence it generally provides less memorable rewards."

If a person feels coerced to read a certain book, to follow a given course because that is supposed to be the way to do it, learning will go against the grain.

Mass leisure, mass culture, and even high culture when only attended to passively and for extrinsic reasons -- such as the wish to flaunt one's status -- are parasites of the mind.

Why is solitude such a negative experience? The bottom-line answer is that keeping order in the mind from within is very difficult. We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed. And when external input is lacking, attention begins to wander, and thoughts become chaotic

To control who can manipulate an object, the security system must first be sure of each user’s identity. This need to guarantee the user’s identity is the reason that Windows requires authenticated logon before accessing any system resources.

When a process requests a handle to an object, the object manager and the security system use the caller’s security identification and the object’s security descriptor to determine whether the caller should be assigned a handle that grants the process access to the object it desires.

It’s important to keep in mind that all the threads in a process share the same handle table, so when a thread opens an object—even if it’s impersonating—all the threads of the process have access to the object.

Instead of using names (which might or might not be unique) to identify entities that perform actions in a system, Windows uses security identifiers (SIDs). Users have SIDs, as do local and domain groups, local computers, domains, domain members, and services.

Mas a verdade é que uma das características de nossa época, uma das fontes ou causas das angústias, conflitos e aflições do nosso tempo parece que está na complexidade, na diversidade e na infidedignidade da comunicação oral ou escrita, quer entre indivíduos quer entre grupos. Sabemos dos mal-entendidos, dos preconceitos, das prevenções, das incompreensões e dos atritos resultantes da incúria da expressão, dos seus sofismas e paralogismos. São as generalizações apressadas, as declarações gratuitas, as indiscriminações, os clichês, os rótulos, os falsos axiomas, a polissemia, a polarização, os falsos juízos, as opiniões discriminatórias, as afirmações puras e simples, carentes de prova... Enfim, linguagem falaciosa, por malícia, quando não por incúria da atividade mental, ou por ignorância dos mais comezinhos princípios da lógica. Esses óbices ou barreiras verbais e mentais impedem ou desfiguram totalmente a comunicação, o entendimento entre os homens e os povos, sendo não raro causa de atritos e conflitos.

In this light, you can see that those upward surges on the mastery curve are by no means the only time anything significant or exciting is happening. Learn- ing generally occurs in stages. A stage ends when the habitual system has been programmed to the new task, and the cognitive and effort systems have with- drawn. This means you can perform the task without making a special effort to think of its separate parts.

I shall argue that the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life. And whenever some of our needs are temporarily met, we immediately start wishing for more. This chronic dissatisfaction is the second obstacle that stands in the way of contentment.

To deal with these obstacles, every culture develops with time protective devices—religions, philosophies, arts, and comforts—that help shield us from chaos. They help us believe that we are in control of what is happening and give reasons for being satisfied with our lot. But these shields are effective only for a while; after a few centuries, sometimes after only a few decades, a religion or belief wears out and no longer provides the spiritual sustenance it once did.

This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment.

An unrealistic trust in the shields, in the cultural myths, can lead to equally extreme disillusion when they fail. This tends to happen whenever a culture has had a run of good luck and for a while seems indeed to have found a way of controlling the forces of nature. At that point it is logical for it to begin believing that it is a chosen people who need no longer fear any major setback. The Romans reached that juncture after several centuries of ruling the Mediterranean, the Chinese were confident of their immutable superiority before the Mongol conquest, and the Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards.

The unwarranted sense of security sooner or later results in a rude awakening. When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.

After a while, however, it becomes obvious that these piecemeal solutions won’t work either. No matter how much energy we devote to its care, the body will eventually give out. If we are learning to be more assertive, we might inadvertently alienate our friends. And if we devote too much time to cultivating new friends, we might threaten relationships with our spouse and family. There are just so many dams about to burst and so little time to tend to them all.

The Great Restructuring, unlike the postwar period, is a particularly good time to have access to capital. To understand why, first recall that bargaining theory, a key component in standard economic thinking, argues that when money is made through the combination of capital investment and labor, the rewards are returned, roughly speaking, proportional to the input. As digital technology reduces the need for labor in many industries, the proportion of the rewards returned to those who own the intelligent machines is growing.

neuroscientists have been exploring the physical mechanisms that drive people’s improvements on hard tasks.

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination.

Yet however much we are aware of it, the self is in many ways the most important element of consciousness, for it represents symbolically all of consciousness’s other contents, as well as the pattern of their interrelations.

If attention, or psychic energy, is directed by the self, and if the self is the sum of the contents of consciousness and the structure of its goals, and if the contents of consciousness and the goals are the result of different ways of investing attention, then we have a system that is going round and round, with no clear causes or effects. At one point we are saying that the self directs attention, at another, that attention determines the self. In fact, both these statements are true: consciousness is not a strictly linear system, but one in which circular causality obtains. Attention shapes the self, and is in turn shaped by it.

One of the main forces that affects consciousness adversely is psychic disorder—that is, information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out. We give this condition many names, depending on how we experience it: pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy. All these varieties of disorder force attention to be diverted to undesirable objects, leaving us no longer free to use it according to our preferences. Psychic energy becomes unwieldy and ineffective.

Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or psychic entropy, a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness. Prolonged experiences of this kind can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals.

News of the fall of the stock market will upset the banker, but it might reinforce the sense of self of the political activist. A new piece of information will either create disorder in consciousness, by getting us all worked up to face the threat, or it will reinforce our goals, thereby freeing up psychic energy.

When the information that keeps coming into awareness is congruent with goals, psychic energy flows effortlessly. There is no need to worry, no reason to question one’s adequacy. But whenever one does stop to think about oneself, the evidence is encouraging: “You are doing all right.” The positive feedback strengthens the self, and more attention is freed to deal with the outer and the inner environment.

When a person is able to organize his or her consciousness so as to experience flow as often as possible, the quality of life is inevitably going to improve, because, as in the case of Rico and Pam, even the usually boring routines of work become purposeful and enjoyable.

It is really a battle for the self; it is a struggle for establishing control over attention. The struggle does not necessarily have to be physical, as in the case of the climber.

Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex than it had been before. It is by becoming increasingly complex that the self might be said to grow. Complexity is the result of two broad psychological processes: differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies.

A self that is only differentiated—not integrated—may attain great individual accomplishments, but risks being mired in self-centered egotism. By the same token, a person whose self is based exclusively on integration will be connected and secure, but lack autonomous individuality. Only when a person invests equal amounts of psychic energy in these two processes and avoids both selfishness and conformity is the self likely to reflect complexity.

You can see it, hear it, smell it, feel it. To love the plateau is to love the eternal now, to enjoy the inevitable spurts of progress and the fruits of accomplishment, then serenely to accept the new plateau that waits just beyond them. To love the plateau is to love what is most essential and enduring in your life.

Essa tela se situa entre você e o seu eu interior, entre você e o próximo, entre você e a natureza, entre você e Deus.

To explore the Thinker and the Prover, try the following: 1. Visualize a quarter vividly, and imagine vividly that you are going to find the quarter on the street. Then, look for the quarter every time you take a walk, meanwhile continuing to visualize it. See how long it takes you to find the quarter. 2. Explain the above experiment by the hypothesis of “selective attention” — that is, believe there are lots of lost quarters everywhere and you were bound to find one by continually looking. Go looking for a second quarter. 3. Explain the experiment by the alternative “mystical” hypothesis that “mind controls everything.” Believe that you made the quarter manifest in this universe. Go looking for a second quarter. 4. Compare the time it takes to find the second quarter using the first hypothesis (attention) with the time it takes using the second hypothesis (mind-over-matter). 5. With your own ingenuity, invent similar experiments and each time compare the two theories — “selective attention” (coincidence) vs. “mind controls everything” (psychokinesis). 6. Avoid coming to any strong conclusions prematurely. At the end of a month, re-read this chapter, think it over again, and still postpone coming to any dogmatic conclusion. Believe it possible that you do not know everything yet, and that you might have something still to learn.

Everybody develops routines to fill in the boring gaps of the day, or to bring experience back on an even keel when anxiety threatens. Some people are compulsive doodlers, others chew on things or smoke, smooth their hair, hum a tune, or engage in more esoteric private rituals that have the same purpose: to impose order in consciousness through the performance of patterned action. These are the “microflow” activities that help us negotiate the doldrums of the day. But how enjoyable an activity is depends ultimately on its complexity. The small automatic games woven into the fabric of everyday life help reduce boredom, but add little to the positive quality of experience.

When all a person’s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person’s attention is completely absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over to process any information but what the activity offers. All the attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli. As a result, one of the most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that the activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.

The justification of climbing is climbing, like the justification of poetry is writing; you don’t conquer anything except things in yourself…. The act of writing justifies poetry. Climbing is the same: recognizing that you are a flow. The purpose of the flow is to keep on flowing, not looking for a peak or utopia but staying in the flow. It is not a moving up but a continuous flowing; you move up to keep the flow going. There is no possible reason for climbing except the climbing itself; it is a self-communication.”

In normal life, we keep interrupting what we do with doubts and questions. “Why am I doing this? Should I perhaps be doing something else?” Repeatedly we question the necessity of our actions, and evaluate critically the reasons for carrying them out. But in flow there is no need to reflect, because the action carries us forward as if by magic.

A composer of music, for instance, may know that he wishes to write a song, or a flute concerto, but other than that, his goals are usually quite vague. And how does he know whether the notes he is writing down are “right” or “wrong”? The same situation holds true for the artist painting a picture, and for all activities that are creative or open-ended in nature. But these are all exceptions that prove the rule: unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them.

In some creative activities, where goals are not clearly set in advance, a person must develop a strong personal sense of what she intends to do. The artist might not have a visual image of what the finished painting should look like, but when the picture has progressed to a certain point, she should know whether this is what she wanted to achieve or not. And a painter who enjoys painting must have internalized criteria for “good” or “bad” so that after each brush stroke she can say: “Yes, this works; no, this doesn’t.” Without such internal guidelines, it is impossible to experience flow.

The kind of feedback we work toward is in and of itself often unimportant: What difference does it make if I hit the tennis ball between the white lines, if I immobilize the enemy king on the chessboard, or if I notice a glimmer of understanding in my patient’s eyes at the end of the therapeutic hour? What makes this information valuable is the symbolic message it contains: that I have succeeded in my goal. Such knowledge creates order in consciousness, and strengthens the structure of the self.

But each of us is temperamentally sensitive to a certain range of information that we learn to value more than most other people do, and it is likely that we will consider feedback involving that information to be more relevant than others might.

A professor of physics who was an avid rock climber described his state of mind while climbing as follows: “It is as if my memory input has been cut off. All I can remember is the last thirty seconds, and all I can think ahead is the next five minutes.” In fact, any activity that requires concentration has a similarly narrow window of time.

But it is not only the temporal focus that counts. What is even more significant is that only a very select range of information can be allowed into awareness. Therefore all the troubling thoughts that ordinarily keep passing through the mind are temporarily kept in abeyance.

Preoccupation with the self consumes psychic energy because in everyday life we often feel threatened. Whenever we are threatened we need to bring the image we have of ourselves back into awareness, so we can find out whether or not the threat is serious, and how we should meet it.

So loss of self-consciousness does not involve a loss of self, and certainly not a loss of consciousness, but rather, only a loss of consciousness of the self. What slips below the threshold of awareness is the concept of self, the information we use to represent to ourselves who we are. And being able to forget temporarily who we are seems to be very enjoyable.

When a person invests all her psychic energy into an interaction—whether it is with another person, a boat, a mountain, or a piece of music—she in effect becomes part of a system of action greater than what the individual self had been before. This system takes its form from the rules of the activity; its energy comes from the person’s attention.

But the true believer is not really interacting with the belief system; he usually lets his psychic energy be absorbed by it. From this submission nothing new can come; consciousness may attain a welcome order, but it will be an order imposed rather than achieved.

Queremos infligir sofrimento, ou senti-lo, ou ambos. Na verdade, não há muita diferença entre os dois. É claro que não temos consciência disso e afirmamos que não queremos sofrer. Mas preste bem atenção e verá que o seu pensamento e o seu comportamento estão programados para continuar com o sofrimento, tanto para você quanto para os outros. Se você estivesse consciente disso, o padrão iria se desfazer, porque desejar mais sofrimento é uma insanidade, e ninguém é insano conscientemente.

Manter-se em um estado de alerta consciente destrói a ligação entre o sofrimento e o mecanismo do pensamento, e aciona o processo de transformação. É como se o sofrimento se tornasse o combustível para a chama da consciência, resultando em um brilho de mais intensidade. Esse é o significado esotérico da antiga arte da alquimia: a transformação do metal não precioso em ouro, do sofrimento em consciência.

To explore the Thinker and the Prover, try the following: 1. Visualize a quarter vividly, and imagine vividly that you are going to find the quarter on the street. Then, look for the quarter every time you take a walk, meanwhile continuing to visualize it. See how long it takes you to find the quarter. 2. Explain the above experiment by the hypothesis of “selective attention” — that is, believe there are lots of lost quarters everywhere and you were bound to find one by continually looking. Go looking for a second quarter. 3. Explain the experiment by the alternative “mystical” hypothesis that “mind controls everything.” Believe that you made the quarter manifest in this universe. Go looking for a second quarter. 4. Compare the time it takes to find the second quarter using the first hypothesis (attention) with the time it takes using the second hypothesis (mind-over-matter). 5. With your own ingenuity, invent similar experiments and each time compare the two theories — “selective attention” (coincidence) vs. “mind controls everything” (psychokinesis). 6. Avoid coming to any strong conclusions prematurely. At the end of a month, re-read this chapter, think it over again, and still postpone coming to any dogmatic conclusion. Believe it possible that you do not know everything yet, and that you might have something still to learn. 7. Convince yourself* (if you are not already convinced) that you are ugly, unattractive and dull. Go to a party in that frame of mind. Observe how people treat you. ~•~ * “Believe” or “convince yourself” – mean to do what an actor does: pretend until the pretense begins to feel real. Or, as Jazz musicians say: “Fake it until you make it.” ~•~ 8. Convince yourself (if you are not already convinced) that you are handsome, irresistible and witty. Go to a party in that frame of mind. Observe how people treat you. 9. This is the hardest of all exercizes and comes in two parts. First, observe closely and dispassionately two dear friends and two relative strangers. Try to figure out what their Thinkers think, and how their Provers methodically set about proving it. Second, apply the same exercize to yourself. If you think you have learned the lessons of these exercizes in less than six months, you haven’t really been working at them. With real work, in six months you should be just beginning to realize how little you know about everything. 10. Believe it possible that you can float off the ground and fly by merely willing it. See what happens. If this exercize proves as disappointing to you as it has to me, try number 11 below, which is never disappointing. 11. Believe that you can exceed all your previous ambitions and hopes in all areas of your life.
