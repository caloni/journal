jun 04 14:59:21 <Dazer>	Every viable way of joining a server on discord is blocked
jun 04 14:59:31 <Dazer>	you join server and it says instand invite expired
jun 04 14:59:32 <@Mossa_Mossa>	That is a lie.
jun 04 14:59:50 <Dazer>	...
jun 04 14:59:55 <Dazer>	I just tried it
jun 04 15:00:02 <@Mossa_Mossa>	How did you try it?
jun 04 15:00:12 <Dazer>	I typed it in browser
jun 04 15:01:05 <@Mossa_Mossa>	What did you find?
jun 04 15:01:24 <Dazer>	"instant invite is now expired"
jun 04 15:01:42 <@Mossa_Mossa>	On what website?
jun 04 15:01:50 <Dazer>	discord
jun 04 15:02:01 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Could you link the website?
jun 04 15:02:35 <Dazer>	https://discordapp.com/satoru
jun 04 15:03:08 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You can't join a Discord group that are private by going to the address like that. You have to find the two ways to join the Server by other means.
jun 04 15:03:54 <Dazer>	Okay, well I was just saying because I thought that was the other way and it bugged
jun 04 15:04:29 <Dazer>	I'm not going to play your game if you don't want me in the server thats fine I guess I'll just go on my own
jun 04 15:04:55 <Dazer>	goodbye everyone, take care! o/
jun 04 15:04:57 <@Mossa_Mossa>	I don't want anything. You are the one that want something.
jun 04 15:05:29 <Dazer>	You don't want me in the server or else you wouldnt of kicked me
jun 04 15:05:44 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You expressed that you didn't want to wake up. That's the only requirement.
jun 04 15:05:57 <Dazer>	I literally said to you in pm that I did
jun 04 15:06:19 <Dazer>	obviously if you lie and twist things I can't do anything against that
jun 04 15:06:25 <@Mossa_Mossa>	When you insulted the people in the chat 3 times in less than 2 hours, that says that you don't want to wake up.
jun 04 15:07:02 <Dazer>	Fine if people insult me tho i take it
jun 04 15:07:16 <@Mossa_Mossa>	No you don't.
jun 04 15:07:26 <Dazer>	Everyone in chat was fine with me except you
jun 04 15:07:49 <@Mossa_Mossa>	It's not about them, just about you.
jun 04 15:08:21 <Dazer>	Whatever man, I'm not doing this like I have already said, you kicked me, denied that I get back in so i'll leave fair enough
jun 04 15:08:40 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You can still get in, you just haven't figured out how.
jun 04 15:08:56 <@Mossa_Mossa>	If you really want to get back in, you can. I can't deny you that entry.
jun 04 15:18:16 <@Mossa_Mossa>	But you don't want to stay in it.
jun 04 15:18:24 <Dazer>	AND YET YOU STILL DENY ME ANYTHING ELSE
jun 04 15:18:34 <Dazer>	YOU STILL TRY TO PUSH ME BACK INTO IT WHEN I AM CLIMBING OUT
jun 04 15:18:46 <@Mossa_Mossa>	The rules are simple: If you want to remain conscious and awake, you may stay in the group.
jun 04 15:19:04 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Realize that there is no fight, there is no struggle. Just let go of your thoughts.
jun 04 15:19:05 <Dazer>	YOU'VE ALREADY FUCKIN JUST SAID THAT I DO SO WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
jun 04 15:19:23 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Is it difficult to be kind towards others?
jun 04 15:19:33 <Dazer>	I ALREADY KNOW IT IS
jun 04 15:19:41 <Dazer>	SO WHY DONT YOU FUCKIN TRY IT
jun 04 15:19:47 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Then do what is needed of you.
jun 04 15:20:00 <Dazer>	AND WHAT IS THAT?

jun 04 15:20:53 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Do you need caps lock to breathe in this reality?
jun 04 15:21:03 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Dazer - Today at 7:31 PM
jun 04 15:21:03 <@Mossa_Mossa>	The only emotional response you have evoked from me today is laughter from your silliness lol
jun 04 15:21:43 <Dazer>	WHATS THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
jun 04 15:21:54 <Dazer>	IT WAS THE ONLY THING YOU EVOKED FROM ME AT THAT POINT
jun 04 15:21:58 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Stop thinking, stop believing that thought is you.
jun 04 15:22:30 <Dazer>	AND YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE THAT I HAVE UNTIL I AM AGREEING WITH EVERY FUCKIN THING YOU SAY WITHOUT ANY REASON TO
jun 04 15:22:45 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Your actions speak louder than your words.
jun 04 15:22:54 <Dazer>	IF I AM CALM THEN YOU POKE ME
jun 04 15:22:59 <Dazer>	IF I AM ANGRY YOU TELL ME TO CALM DOWN

jun 04 15:23:58 <@Mossa_Mossa>	That the suffering you have experienced is not you, just a thing in your life.
jun 04 15:24:07 <Dazer>	I WASNT FUCKIN ANGRY TILL YOU TRIED TO MAKE ME ANGRY
jun 04 15:24:16 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You are a very strong being, but you believe you are weak because the voice in the mind said so.
jun 04 15:24:22 <Dazer>	IM NOT FUCKIN WEAK
jun 04 15:25:01 <@Mossa_Mossa>	What you are, when you are not this thing, you are the silent appreciation of all things.
jun 04 15:25:15 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You probably died once before, but you chose to come back.
jun 04 15:25:31 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You forgot this, and believe that you are the voice in your mind. The illusion.
jun 04 15:25:33 <Dazer>	I ASK FOR YOUR HELP AND YOU SPIT IN MY FUCKING FACE
jun 04 15:25:46 <@Mossa_Mossa>	I am helping the one that is not talking.

jun 04 15:27:03 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Awakening is not logical. If you try to use logic to understand it, you will just go insane.
jun 04 15:27:20 <Dazer>	I FUCKIN FORGAVE YOU THEN YOU JUST KEPT BLANKING ME
jun 04 15:27:23 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Your caps lock is still active.

jun 04 15:30:01 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Why choose to feel bad when you can choose not to?
jun 04 15:30:13 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Ego can't choose however. It is in default mode.
jun 04 15:30:19 <Dazer>	BECAUSE FEELING THE OTHER WAY DIDN'T FUCKIN WORK DID IT

jun 04 15:36:18 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You teach me many things, but I will not partake in your world of madness.
jun 04 15:36:47 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Opinions are not honesty. Facts are more than honest. And more honest than both, not saying anything.

jun 04 15:40:00 <Dazer>	WHAT I HAD BEFORE IN THE DISCORD WAS DEFAULY
jun 04 15:40:10 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Energy drained into anger to make yourself look powerful. All to be tired by tomorrow and cry in a pillow.
jun 04 15:40:17 <Dazer>	THIS IS EFFORT, THIS IS STRAIN ON ME, TO BE SO FUCKIN VISCIOUS AND STUPID
jun 04 15:40:33 <Dazer>	IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO BE KIND TO YOU
jun 04 15:40:38 <Dazer>	IT IS MUCH EASIER TO BE CALM
jun 04 15:40:40 <Dazer>	TO RELAX
jun 04 15:40:42 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Is this a strain on you? Then why do you choose it?
jun 04 15:40:46 <Dazer>	BUT YOU DON'T FUCKIN DESERVE THAT
jun 04 15:40:50 <Dazer>	WHY SHOULD I CHOOSE IT?
jun 04 15:40:57 <Dazer>	YOU ARE THE ON SAYING CHOOSE THE HARDEST PATH
jun 04 15:40:59 <@Mossa_Mossa>	So you have requirements on who deserves your kindness.
jun 04 15:41:16 <Dazer>	YES PIECES OF SHIT DO NOT DESERVE MY KINDNESS
jun 04 15:41:25 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Who decides who is a piece of shit?
jun 04 15:41:35 <Dazer>	MUSLIM HORDES BOMBING CHILDREN DO NOT DESERVE KINDNESS
jun 04 15:41:38 <Dazer>	I FUCKIN DECIDE

jun 04 15:41:51 <Dazer>	YES ME
jun 04 15:41:55 <Dazer>	I DECIDE
jun 04 15:42:05 <@Mossa_Mossa>	If anyone, isn't those who harm others the ones that needs kindness the most?
jun 04 15:42:12 <Dazer>	NO
jun 04 15:42:19 <Dazer>	THEY DESERVE TO BE SHOT IN THE HEAD
jun 04 15:42:20 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Then they'll continue harming others.
jun 04 15:42:26 <Dazer>	NOT IF THEY ARE DEAD
jun 04 15:42:29 <@Mossa_Mossa>	So you deserve to be shot in the head?
jun 04 15:42:32 <Dazer>	YOU HAVE SHOWN ME NO KINDNESS
jun 04 15:42:53 <@Mossa_Mossa>	By your standards, no one shows you kindness. You can't even see it.
jun 04 15:43:00 <Dazer>	YES WE ALL DESERVE TO BE SHOT IN THE HEAD ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
jun 04 15:43:04 <Dazer>	NO ONE DOES SHOW ME KINDNESS
jun 04 15:43:09 <@Mossa_Mossa>	Do you want more kindness?
jun 04 15:43:19 <Dazer>	ITS ALL HOLLOW AND FAKE AND ONLY SERVES THERE OWN GAIN
jun 04 15:43:41 <Dazer>	NO I DONT DESERVE KINDNESS EITHER
jun 04 15:43:56 <@Mossa_Mossa>	I give to you, room to consolidate the origin of suffering, the one voice in your mind. That is my kindness to you.
jun 04 15:44:29 <Dazer>	WELL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IS TELLING YOU HOW MUCH OF A SELF-INFATUATED PRICK YOU ARE
jun 04 15:44:51 <Dazer>	SO GO SIT ON YOUR FUCKIN KINDNESS ASSHOLE
jun 04 15:44:57 <@Mossa_Mossa>	You'll need a box of tissues, some music and perhaps a movie. And just sit still and don't move. Don't think.
