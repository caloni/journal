Acha que conhece de cinema? E que tal tentar adivinhar por um punhado de palavras de um crÃ­tico sobre qual filme estamos falando?

> If the audience ever started giggling at the sounds and tricks, the picture might collapse, because it's entirely mechanical and impersonal.

> Those who say it is too long have developed cinematic attention deficit disorder. I wanted these characters to live, talk, deceive, and scheme for hours and hours.

> If you think I have given away plot details, you think there can be doubt about whether the heroine survives the first half of a two-part action movie, and should seek help.

> ... for QT, all shots in a sense are references to other shots, not particular shots from other movies, but archetypal shots in our collective moviegoing memories.

> ... is immersed in the atmosphere and lore of film noir, but it doesn't seem like a period picture -- it believes its noir values and isn't just using them for decoration.

> ... is a powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart it strips bare.

> ... leaps into the air, shakes his fist at the city, and you know he's sending a message to the whole movie industry.
