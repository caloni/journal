2019-06-09 Film Theory and Criticism 8th ed. (Leo Braudy, Marshall Cohen)
 - There is a law in psychology that lays it down that if an emotion give birth to a certain movement, by imitation of this movement the corresponding emotion can be called forth. (sobre edição)
 - Entre as ferramentas da edição pode-se usar o contrastre, o simbolismo, o paralelismo, simultaneidade (tem a ver com o tempo) e por último o Leitmotif, que é como o refrão de uma música.
 - Na edição se combina elementos visuais como se combinam kanjis, que formam representações de algo que não pode ser graficamente representado.

2019-05-28 C Programming Language (2nd Edition) (Brian W. Kernighan e Dennis Ritchie)
 - Os autores começam dizendo que C é uma linguagem de relativo baixo nível. O que eles querem dizer não é menosprezar sua capacidade, mas dizer que C lida com abstrações que a maioria dos computadores lida diretamente, como caracteres, números e endereços, e esses podem ser combinados e movidos usando os operadores lógico-aritméticos implementados por máquinas reais. E esse é o conceito de baixo nível de C. Curioso que ao falar sobre isso os autores também comentam que apesar dos controladores de fluxo C é single-threaded, não suportando na linguagem o conceito de threads, multiprogramação, operações paralelas, sincronização e, pasmem, corrotinas (isso já estava em voga na época?).
 - E pra finalizar sua introdução ele deixa claro que C retém a filosofia básica que o programador sabe o que está fazendo; só requer que ele deixe suas intenções de forma explícita.
Nevertheless, C retains the basic philosophy that programmers know what they are doing; it only requires that they state their intentions explicitly.

2019-04-12 [ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results (Gary Keller)](https://www.amazon.com.br/One-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776?tag=kns00-20&ascsubtag=go_952006559_46722489029_301325114634_dsa-413046190713_c_29043173378)

 - "Going small" is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do.
 - There will always be just a few things that matter more than the rest, and out of those, one will matter most. Internalizing this concept is like being handed a magic compass. Whenever you feel lost or lacking direction, you can pull it out to remind yourself to discover what matters most.
 - Once you've figured out what actually matters, keep asking what matters most until there is only one thing left. That core activity goes at the top of your success list.
 - Say no. Whether you say "later" or "never," the point is to say "not now" to anything else you could do until your most important work is done. 
 - Don't get trapped in the "check off" game. If we believe things don't matter equally, we must act accordingly. 
 - The truth is that things don't matter equally and success is found in doing what matters most.
 - You don't need to be a disciplined person to be successful. In fact, you can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.
 - The payoff from developing the right habit is pretty obvious. It gets you the success you're searching for. What sometimes gets overlooked, however, is an amazing windfall: it also simplifies your life. Your life gets clearer and less complicated because you know what you have to do well and you know what you don't. The fact of the matter is that aiming discipline at the right habit gives you license to be less disciplined in other areas.
 - When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.
 - Australian researchers Megan Oaten and Ken Cheng have even found some evidence of a halo effect around habit creation. In their studies, students who successfully acquired one positive habit reported less stress; less impulsive spending; better dietary habits; decreased alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption; fewer hours watching TV; and even fewer dirty dishes. Sustain the discipline long enough on one habit, and not only does it become easier, but so do other things as well. It's why those with the right habits seem to do better than others. They're doing the most important thing regularly and, as a result, everything else is easier.
 - So how do you put your willpower to work? You think about it. Pay attention to it. Respect it. You make doing what matters most a priority when your willpower is its highest. In other words, you give it the time of day it deserves.
 - What taxes your willpower: Implementing new behaviors, filtering distractions, resisting temptation, suppressing emotion, restraining aggression, suppressing impulses, taking tests, trying to impress others, coping with fear, doing something you don't enjoy, selecting long-term over short-term rewards.
 - When you gamble with your time, you may be placing a bet you can't cover. Even if you're sure you can win, be careful that you can live with what you lose.
 - When you're supposed to be working, work, and when you're supposed to be playing, play. It's a weird tightrope you're walking, but it's only when you get your priorities mixed up that things fall apart.
 - No one knows their ultimate ceiling for achievement, so worrying about it is a waste of time.
 - When you allow yourself to accept that big is about who you can become, you look at it differently.
 - Big ideas: think big, avoid incremental thinking that simply asks, "What do I do next?", this is at best the slow lane to success and, at worst, the off ramp. Ask bigger questions.
 - A good rule of thumb is to double down everywhere in your life. If your goal is ten, ask the question: "How can I reach 20?" Set a goal so far above what you want that you'll be building a plan that practically guarantees your original goal.
 - Here's what I found out: We overthink, overplan, and overanalyze our careers, our businesses, and our lives; that long hours are neither virtuous nor healthy; and that we usually succeed in spite of most of what we do, not because of it. I discovered that we can't manage time, and that the key to success isn't in all the things we do but in the handful of things we do well.
 - Mark Twain agreed with Carnegie and described it this way: The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.
 - Voltaire once wrote, "Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers." 
 - Sir Francis Bacon added, "A prudent question is one-half of wisdom." 
 - Indira Gandhi concluded that "the power to question is the basis of all human progress."
 - The Focusing Question collapses all possible questions into one: "What's the ONE Thing I can do / such that by doing it / everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

2019-05-14 [Lessons learned from On Writing Well](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-on-writing-well/), por Robin Wieruch, gera alguns insights diferentes dos que tive na [minha própria resenha](/reading/on-writing-well).

 - Make the written word your own - make it personal - only then the reader will go with you. 
 - Build up your sentences in a logical order. Think in building blocks, like in a project, where each block follows another building block. Don't write by accident. 
 - The most important sentence is your first sentence. The second most important sentence is the second sentence. Each sentence builds up on the other. 

2019-05-09 [How to hack your biology and be in the zone every single day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xc3XdOiGGI), de Dr Alan Watkins, ensina que é possível controlar conscientemente seu estado de espírito para ser mais produtivo através da respiração.

 - O ritmo da respiração é o fator mais importante.
 - A eletricidade do corpo está 20x mais concentrada no coração do que no cérebro (que está disperso).
 - A quantidade de batimentos por segundo determina o estado de excitação, mas é o ritmo que determina o estado de espírito (positivo ou negativo).

2019-05-09 [Practical discipline](http://www.wisdomination.com/practical-discipline/), de Zbyhnev, é um guia sucinto de como aumentar a produtividade simplesmente fazendo.

 - Consistency is a matter of survival for your sense of self. 

2019-05-09 [Chimpanzés falam, mentem e recitam poesias com a linguagem dos sinais](https://exame.abril.com.br/ciencia/chimpanzes-falam-mentem-e-recitam-poesias-com-a-linguagem-dos-sinais/), por Sergio Andreu, ensina que chimpanzés podem ensinar sua família a linguagem de sinais aprendida.

 - Mais surpreendente foi registrado em outra gravação na qual um dos chimpanzés repetia "chorar, chorar; vermelho, vermelho; silêncio, silêncio; divertido, divertido", um enigma para a equipe até que um amigo poeta do casal apontou que os sinais destas palavras eram similares e que se tratava de uma aliteração da língua de sinais, ou seja, uma composição poética. 

2019-05-09 [(Deep Work) => Flow - A proven Path to Satisfaction](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/), de Robin Wieruch, é um resumo valioso de dois livros, um sobre deep work e outro sobre flow, e como ambos se relacionam. Robin é um programador e também leu On Writing Well (ele possui [algumas notas](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-on-writing-well/) sobre essa leitura também).

 - Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push you cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
 - Flow can be produced by small things that cause active enjoyment rather than passive pleasure. 
 - The flow session, that can be supported by deep work, has an impact on our self. The self grows with each challenge and with each opportunity we can improve ourselves as human being. The improvements of the self and the fulfilled activities on the way can lead to a satisfied and meaningful life. 
 - "The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive." 
 - Whenever you repeat something, a circuit in the brain will fire oftentimes and strengthen the skill like a muscle in your brain. You improve your self. 
 - He sees the solution in becoming independent of external rewards. These rewards have to be substituted for internal rewards. For instance, life long learning, achieving worthwhile challenges or the fulfillment in helping others. Only then a human being is in full control of the self. In full control of happiness and sadness. 
 - You need to use an "arsenal of routines and rituals designed with the science of limited willpower in mind to maximize the amount of deep work". Smart routines make it possible to make less decisions and to do less balancing of different tasks. 
 - The journalistic philosophy is the last and most advanced philosophy. In that approach you can rapidly switch between shallow to deep work. Yet we know that a disadvantage of multitasking is the usage of our finite willpower. That's why the approach is only for advanced deep workers. Cal Newport says that "[it] require[s] a sense of confidence in your work." and that "[it] requires a conviction that what you are doing is important and will succeed". You can support the philosophy by preparing your deep work schedule in advance. It will help you to preserve your willpower. 
 - Whenever you are going deep, you have to ritualize it. There are 3 basics to assist your deep work session: time, support and metrics. 
 - You can operate similar to a business. For instance, imagine a software product that gets an additional feature. The team will come up with a minimum viable product (MVP) for the feature. But the MVP needs planning. A MVP has by definition a minimum yet valuable outcome. The same planning you would need for your own outcome. You have to "identify a small number of ambitious outcomes". 
 - I can recommend to read the book [The One Thing](https://www.amazon.com.br/One-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776?tag=kns00-20&ascsubtag=go_952006559_46722489029_301325114772_dsa-413046190713_c_29043173378) by Gary Keller. It gives a clear guidance how you can deploy short term objectives that contribute to long term goals. 
 - To track progress enables you to gather feedback about your efforts. Are you on track? Did you have a bad week? Maybe it is time to recalibrate your efforts based on the feedback. 
 - The attention restoration theory (ART) claims that directed attention is a finite resource. If it exhausts, you will struggle to concentrate. It can be seen quite similar to the finite amount of willpower. The conclusion is that your deep work time per day is limited. 
 - You need time to rest. Therefore you can deploy productive meditations - that's how Cal Newport calls it - where you do physical work (fitness workout, house cleaning) and no mental work. Apart from that research says that spending time in nature improves your ability to concentrate. 
 - End your day with a Shutdown Ritual 
 - the Zeigarnik Effect . It is "the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention". You unconscious mind might help you to solve a problem until your next workday starts (Take a Nap). 
 - Give your goals a hard deadline that is lesser than your estimated time. The shallow work will become dispensable when you have less time for the task at hand. 
 - Research shows that a trained memory improves your ability to concentrate. 
 - The schedule can be used to guide your working day. However you shouldn't forcefully stick to the schedule. It should only guide you, but you can adjust it during the day. It should leave opportunities for improvisation and encourage spontaneity. 
 - Deep work can be used as a technique to get into a state of flow. The state of flow can be your path in life to accomplish happiness, to be in control of your life and to be independent of social rewards. It can also be your path to accomplish challenges in your professional life. 
 - Without consciousness we would know what happens around us, but we couldn't give it any value. 
 - A person can make himself happy regardless of the circumstances surrounding him. It depends on the direction of your attention. 
 - "After each episode of flow a person becomes more of a unique individual, less predictable, possessed of rarer skills". The self can grow when there is order in consciousness. 
 - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi sees enjoyment as another component in our life. Enjoyment, in contrast to pleasure, can generate a flow experience. For instance, you can eat food with pleasure, because it is a need of your body. Or you can eat food with enjoyment. Mihaly takes a gourmet as an example for a person who enjoys to eat. The gourmet understands each ingredient in a meal and can focus attention to its different sensations. It is an accomplishment to bring up the attention and to experience the diversities in a meal. 
 - It can happen in a competition too. The challenge can be an enjoyment. But only when you concentrate on the activity itself rather than beating your opponent or impressing the audience. The self will grow only when you want to perfect a skill rather than earning external rewards. It is when "the person is paying attention to the activity for its own sake; when it is not, the attention is focused on its consequences". 
 - The state of flow leaves no space for disorder in consciousness. It removes the awareness of the daily life, your worries and dreams, and you lose the sense of your self. The time in and after the state of flow can be seen as paradox. The self doesn't grow during the flow session itself, but after it. 
 - The irony is that oftentimes work is easier to enjoy than free time. Activities at work have the conditions to experience flow. Free time on the other hand is unstructured. It is a greater effort to shape it and to find and perform flow activities. 
 - On a human beings highest potential, a person is able to translate threats into enjoyable challenges. It supports a person to stay in harmony and to live a satisfied life. The word autotelic derives from the Greek words auto and telos which mean self and goal. An autotelic experience describes a self-contained activity. It is an activity solely performed for the intrinsic rewards which strengthens the self. Flow is an autotelic experience. 
 - When experience is intrinsically rewarding life is justified in the present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain." 
 - "The autotelic individual grows beyond the limits of individuality by investing psychic energy [attention] in a system in which she is included. Because of this union of the person and the system, the self emerges at a higher level of complexity." 
 - "Flow drives individuals to creativity and outstanding achievement. The necessity to develop increasingly refined skills to sustain enjoyment is what lies behind the evolution of culture." 
 - "If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you'll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed []" by Cal Newport.
