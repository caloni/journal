title: Cracking the code interview
---

Este livro foi recomendado pela minha amiga para treinar para as entrevistas técnicas que ando fazendo. Escolhi ler este em seguida após terminar o Algorithm For Dummies. As primeiras anotações são como compor o CV e qual a estratégia de cada big tech nos seus processos. Escapei esta parte, não estou interessado em trabalhar em um Google da vida. Porém, há alguns detalhes que achei relevante recortar.

> False negatives are acceptable. This is sad (and frustrating for candidates), but true. From the company's perspective, it's actually acceptable that some good candidates are rejected. The company is out to build a great set of employees. They can accept that they miss out on some good people.
> (...)
> They're far more concerned with false positives: people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

> Could you learn it as needed? Sure. But it's very difficult to know that you should use a binary search tree if you don't know of its existence. And if you do know of its existence, then you pretty much know the basics.

> Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process. When a candidate is given a computer, their communication drops substantially.

>
> If you are thinking right now that you have too much experience and can't fit it all on one or two pages, trust me, you can. Long resumes are not a reflection of having tons of experience; they're a reflection of not understanding how to prioritize content.

> For each role, try to discuss your accomplishments with the following approach: "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to z". Here's an example:
> - Reduced object rendering time by 75% by implementing distributed caching, leading to a 10% reduction in log-in time.
> Here's another example with an alternate wording:
> - Increased average match accuracy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparison algorithm based on windiff.
