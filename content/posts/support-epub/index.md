title: Support EPUB
---

Amazon gave up about supporting MOBI format and the next generation readers are already starting to discontinue it and use ePUB instead. The published blog is using Kindlegen to make the book structure and it is a monolithic book hard to open in ePUB readers.

We need to discontinue Kindlegen approach and use ePUB format as the main format. It is possible to support MOBI yet (to old readers as mine) converting the ePUB to MOBI. 

In order to do that [this link](http://bbebooksthailand.com/bb-epub-kindlegen-tutorial.html) has the tips and tricks to maintain a bunch of pages in a book format that is publishable. Nevertheless, I already stole a hugo conversion from [this blog](https://weitblick.org). It is already in the master branch (themes/epub).

The same indexes available in the current book must be available after this conversion.
