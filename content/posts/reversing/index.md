title: 'Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering'
---

Publicado pela Wiley em 2005, bem na época que comecei a me enveredar no trabalho com análise de trojans e técnicas antidebugging, o livro de Eldad Eilam veio bem a calhar na época e agora virá bem a calhar novamente, pois irei voltar a trabalhar na área.

Naquela época começavam a surgir os ataques aos bancos online no Brasil e existia até um tookit que espalhava uma técnica ou duas entre os laranjas que queriam tirar uma casquinha da nova onda. O livro de Eilam busca juntar cada aspecto da engenharia reversa em um apanhado que irá nos dar insights e modus operandi de como proceder para cada tipo de desafio.

> Reverse engineering has been with us a long time. The conceptual Reversing process occurs every time someone looks at someone else's code. But, it also occurs when a developer looks at his or her own code several days after it was written. Reverse engineering is a discovery process. When we take a fresh look at code, whether developed by ourselves or others, we examine and we learn and we see things we may not expect. 

> In the early 1980s, IBM decided that it would no longer release to its customers the source code for its mainframe computer operating systems. Mainframe customers had always relied on the source code for reference in problem solving and to tailor, modify, and extend the IBM operating system products. I still have my button from the IBM user group Share that reads: "If SOURCE is outlawed, only outlaws will have SOURCE," a word play on a famous argument by opponents of gun-control laws. 

> Reverse engineering is a process where an engineered artifact (such as a car, a jet engine, or a software program) is deconstructed in a way that reveals its innermost details, such as its design and architecture. This is similar to scientific research that studies natural phenomena, with the difference that no one commonly refers to scientific research as reverse engineering, simply because no one knows for sure whether or not nature was ever engineered. 

> Which bring us to the most basic point to remember about assembly language: it is a class of languages, not one language. Every computer platform has its own assembly language that is usually quite different from all the rest.
