title: Impact of sugar on the body, brain, and behavior
---

Estava curioso para saber quais as últimas pesquisas, ou melhor, o apanhado de pesquisas, que valida o que sabemos sobre o efeito do açúcar no corpo. Tenho picos de sugar craving e este é um dos pontos que a auto-análise sozinha não funciona. É preciso cavar mais a fundo na fisiologia do próprio corpo.

## Recortes

> Sugar typically refers to a category of simple carbohydrates that includes monosaccharides like fructose and glucose, and disaccharides, like sucrose and lactose, which have different effects on the body and brain. 

> Sucrose, or table sugar, is a disaccharide made up of one-part glucose and one-part fructose. 

> Because most added sugar consumption comes from sucrose or HFCS, we typically consume both fructose and glucose together. However, research on the individual monosaccharides, fructose and glucose, has revealed large differences in how they affect the body. 

> Most of the glucose in the blood stream is not stored in the liver but rather, through the action of insulin, quickly passes through to muscle, adipose, and other peripheral tissues where it can immediately be used as energy (). Fructose, on the other hand, is a less direct source of energy. Independent of insulin, the liver converts fructose to glucose, lactate, and/or fatty acids before passing it to the blood stream where it can be oxidized in other tissues for energy 

> Glucose from the bloodstream is the main source of energy for the brain 

> In contrast, fructose cannot directly supply the brain with energy as it crosses the blood brain barrier to a much lesser degree than glucose 

> There are two principal rewarding aspects of sugar consumption: nutrition and taste. Rodent studies have indicated that these two aspects are distinct and dissociable and may follow different neural pathways 

> While the nutritive reward of sugar in mice causes DA release primarily in the dorsal striatum, the sweetness reward is concentrated in the ventral striatum 

> This suggests that DRD2 in the NAc are essential both for regulating peripheral glucose levels as well as the reinforcement/reward learning of glucose consumption (), which explains why dysregulation of this system may lead to overeating. 

> Just as fructose and glucose have different metabolic pathways, they have different hedonic effects on the brain and behavior.
