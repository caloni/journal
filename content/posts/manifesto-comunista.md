title: Manifesto Comunista (recortes)
---
> The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. 

> Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature; it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat. 

> The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. 

> The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself. 

> In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i. e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working-class, developed, a class of laborers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labor increases capital. 

> Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. 

> At this stage the laborers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition.
