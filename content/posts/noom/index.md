I was wondering about my food cravings (again) and started to research about weight body exercises for the morning and stumble in this paid app about losing weight. I am willing to give a shot for 3 USD until March 23th because what it basically does is to create an health mind environment where you log what you eat and lear what kind of foods are better to avoid weight gains. Accordingly with the app, all backup up by science (some article links are missing during the studies, though).
