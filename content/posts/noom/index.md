I was wondering about my food cravings (again) and started to research about weight body exercises for the morning and stumble in this paid app about losing weight. I am willing to give a shot for two weeks. What it basically does is to create an environment where you have a routine to log what you eat, exercise, drink, leveraging the food logs to conscientiously avoid foods with high density calories. Accordingly with the app, all this is backup up by science (some article links are missing during the studies, though).

The new habits that you are develop day by day are becoming second nature. Meal planning, healthy snacking and enjoying treats in moderation are all not easy, but since they are automatic it shouldn't be an issue.

Food Caloric Density (CD) can be measured by the quantity of calories a food have divided by its weight. If you eat food with low CD you can feel full with less calories. So the Noom philosophy is simple: eas more food with low caloric density.

And the more water a food has, the lower its caloric density. Here are some low CD alternatives for meal:

For breakfast, opt for hard-boiled eggs instead of fried eggs, replace 1/2 cup of granola with 1/2 cup of oatmeal cooked in water, spread whole-grain toast with 2 tablespoons of unsweetened jam instead of peanut butter.

For lunch, top a salad with tuna packed in water instead of tuna packet in oil, use lettuce or collard greens as a wrap instead of a tortilla, start your meal with a broth-based vegetable soup instead of a cream-based soup.

For dinner, cook your vegetables in a nonstick pan instead of sautéing them in oil, replace 1 cup of traditional pasta with 1 cup of spaghetti squash, serve your chicken with a baked potate instead of fries.

For snacks, swap a serving of chips with 3 cups of plain air-popped popcorn, serve 1 cup of low-fat yogurt instead of 1 cup of full-fat yogurt, snack on 1 cup of grapes instead of 1/4 cup of raisins.

Drinking water is important. Adults are made of 60% water and the blood is 90% water. Drinking enough water help your body remove waste and flush out toxins, keep your joints lubricated and help you limber up, support smoother digestion, help your organ systems perform at their best, keep you regular.

Some tricks you can use to reach your hydration faster are:

- Warm it up: drink a cup of herbal tea or hot water with lemon. Both are hydrating and both count as "water".
- Add bubbles: have a glass of sparking or seltzer water, what counts as water, too.
- Flavor it: add fresh-squeezed lemon and lime, a handful of berries, or a splash of 100% juice.
- Wake up and water: first thing in the morning, polish off a large glass of water. It'll kick-start your water intake and is a great way to rehydrate after a long night's sleep.
- Keep it around: out of sigh, out of mind. So, carry a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day.
- Take a break: replace your traditional morning coffee break with a water break.
- Serve it as a side: serve (and commit to finish) a glass of water with each meal and snack.

To deal with difficult situations over time, here are a psych trick: enter repeatedly into the same tough situation, and it gets increasingly less anxiety-inducing with time. It's like building muscle: you do it not once, but over and over again. Psychologists call it exposure. The opposite is also true. Consistently avoid an uncomfortable situation, and you'll build a habit of avoidance.

To know what food are low or high CD, Noom classified foods in three categories:

- Green foods have the lowest caloric density and/or the highest concentration of nutrients (vegetables and whole grains).
- Yellow foods have a mid-level caloric density and/or a medium concentration of nutrients (lean meats and starches).
- Orange foods have the highest caloric density and/or the least nutrients (higher-fat meats and desserts).

Noom recommend consuming 30% (a third) of green foods, 45% (less than half) of yellow foods and 25% (a quarter) orange foods.

More examples of foods:

Green: whole-grain bread, skim milk, sauerkraut, tofu, spinach, apples, cucumbers, tomatoes, nonfat yogurt, broccoli, brown rice, bananas, bellpeppers, strawberries, shrimp, nonfat cheese, unsweetened almond milk, oatmeal, quinoa.

Yellow: lentils, grilled chicken, turkey breast, tuna, salmon, lean ground beef, eggs, avocado, low-fat cheese, black beans, chickpeas.

Orange: oils, seeds, nuts, nut butters, chocolate, potato chips, wine, ranch dressing.

To lose weight, Noom defines based in your age, height, weight, sex and activity level a calories range, where you must reach between the low and high level. This range is bellow the calories your body uses in a daily basis, so you are losing weight if consumes into this range. The lowest point in the range faster, the highest point in the range slower. It is a range to be reached, as Noom note that eating bellow this range can lead to headache, fatigue, a weakened immune system and it can slow down the metabolism.

My calories range in 57kg is bewteen 1620 and 1930 cals. It is very broad choice I have. Accordinly to Noom, not every day is easy, so you can choose what days are you going to consume in the high range and in the low range.

Besides all this rules to mantain the eating habits, there is a SOS plan stablished by the user. You can choose to receive an email or message or dealing yourself with the lack of logging activity in the app for some time (one to three days in a row). Noom understands that one day off is okay, but 3 in a row could translate to some problem with the plan.

Stress

Dealing with stress is accomplished by Noom teaching some breath exercises:

For your body: Falling-out breath. This one is great for releasing physical tension in your body. 1) Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs as much as possible, 2) at the top of your breath, take one more sip of air and 3) exhale with a big, out-loud sigh (something like "HHHAAAAA") as you release all the air.

For your mind: Box breath. This one can help increase your mindfullness. 1) Inhale to the count of four, 2) Hold your breath at the top to the count of four, 3) exhale to the count of four and 4) hold your breath at the bottom to the count of four.

For your self: Emptying breath. This can activate your parasympathetic nervous system and calm your sympathetic nervous system. In other words, it can help you and your body take it all down a notch. 1) Inhale to the count of three and 2) exhale slowly to the count of six, release as much air as you can.

Your parasympathetic nervous system is a network of nerves that relaxes your body after periods of stress or danger. It also helps run life-sustaining processes, like digestion, during times when you feel safe and relaxed.

Your sympathetic nervous system is a network of nerves that helps your body activate its “fight-or-flight” response. This system's activity increases when you're stressed, in danger or physically active.
