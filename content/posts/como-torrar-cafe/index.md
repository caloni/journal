title: Como torrar café
---

Desde que torrei o primeiro batch de grãos que trouxe de Poços comecei a pesquisar sobre torra caseira. Ajuntei alguns textos e comecei a fazer anotações. Este assunto é o fora do trabalho que me empolga mais no momento. Espero fazer um bom trabalho de pesquisa e compilação do que encontrar de conteúdo. Estou pensando em transformar esta pesquisa em um primeiro case de referências e etc.

## [What Is French Roast Coffee? A Guide to Buying and Brewing French Roast Coffee](https://www.thespruceeats.com/french-roast-coffee-765178) (Lindsey Goodwin)

One crack comes from the release of steam.

Another crack happens when the cell walls break down and release oils to the surface of the beans.

In most roasts, coffee beans only crack once.

To be sure, dark French roast coffee is a very dark roast, but if you're looking for something that's even darker, choose Spanish roast coffee. It is the darkest roast available.

Espresso roast is just a little lighter than French roast. It is the most popular roast for espresso shots. Lighter than that is the Full roast, a category of roasts that includes High roast, Continental roast, and Vienna roast.


## [How To Roast Coffee Beans](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-roast-coffee-beans-4799873) (Pete Scherer)

The first point of interest you will encounter along the timeline is called "first crack." You will know it by the popping or snapping sound you hear.

Visually, the beans will have expanded somewhat, their color will be a matte light brown, and they may smell like malt or baking bread, often with aroma top notes like fruit, flowers, or herbs. This point is significant because it's here that the coffee starts to be drinkable. In coffee lingo, this roast level is called "city," and, with more time, "city plus."

The second significant moment in the timeline is called "second crack." When second crack begins, the roast is called "full city." The sound of second crack begins softly but becomes progressively more violent as the roast goes on. The beans have expanded further, sport a consistent medium-brown color with less matte, more shine, and aromas of chocolate and toast.

Further down the timeline, second crack becomes louder. The beans will appear dark brown with an oily sheen, and the aromas will be deeply dark and roasted. There may be some light smoke. This zone is called Vienna, and later French. French is the last stop on the timeline, and the beginning of the end of drinkability.

First, keep the coffee moving while it roasts. You can do this by hand—shaking your pan or cranking a whirly pop—or by machine. Either way, moving the beans means even heating and a consistent roast.

The second guideline is based on some deep empirical research in the roasting community, and also concerns heat. In a nutshell, you want to heat the beans quickly at first, then more slowly as time goes on. In practice, that means to preheat your roaster before adding the beans, then lower the heat a little at the moment of first crack.

Try to cool the beans to room temperature within three to five minutes. You may want to use a fan.

Wait at least twenty-four hours before brewing.

During this rest period, the coffee will release carbon dioxide which otherwise would interfere with flavor extraction during brewing. For peak flavor, use your freshly roasted coffee within two to seven days


## [Coffee Roast Guide](https://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/Coffee-Roasts-Guide)

Roasting causes chemical changes to take place as the beans are rapidly brought to very high temperatures. When they reach the peak of perfection, they are quickly cooled to stop the process. Roasted beans smell like coffee, and weigh less because the moisture has been roasted out. They are crunchy to the bite, ready to be ground and brewed.


## [A Beginners Guide to Coffee Roasts](https://espresso-works.com/blogs/coffee-life/coffee-roasts)

Coffee roasting is the process in which the coffee beans are heated in order to achieve solubility — that is, the ability to dissolve in water.

Once you’ve roasted a batch of coffee beans, it’s like activating a timer. They must be consumed within a certain period of time since the flavor created by the chemical reaction from the roasting process will slowly diminish if the beans remain unused for too long.


## [Ultimate Coffee Roasting Guide](https://www.coffeegrindguru.com/ultimate-coffee-roasting-guide/#google_vignette) (Tyler Heal)

When the temperature is too hot, then the beans risk being ‘gooey’ on the inside and tasting burnt.

When the temperature is too low, then the beans will fall ‘flat’ as all of the aroma has escaped and resulted in a ‘dry’ flavor profile.

it’s important to measure every aspect of the heating up phase and monitoring, measuring, and tracking the key ‘milestones’ of the process. These include annotation of the following:

Now, it is important to note, that there is no right or wrong way to roast a coffee bean, but if you are in the business of entertaining or simply enjoying your coffee, then it’s important to measure every aspect of the heating up phase and monitoring, measuring, and tracking the key ‘milestones’ of the process. These include annotation of the following:

 - Time spent getting to charge temperature (discussed below)
 - All color changes
 - Timing and length of first crack
 - Elapsed time between first and second crack
 - Total roast time
 - Starting batch size
 - Moisture loss from start to end

Rate of rise, or ROR, is linked to bean temperature (or BT; discussed below), and is the rate or speed at which this little green seed is transforming into a darker hew.

DTR is development time, or DT, ratio and is the time from the first crack to the end of the roast and should account for 25% of the entire roast period.

BT stands for bean temperature and it will change drastically due to changes occurring within the bean both chemically and physically since the crack means the bean can release moisture and, in so doing, change the temperature within the drum. This, for many reasons, is incredibly important and noted in the graph.

TP is the turning point, or the lowest point of the temperature trough and delineates the moment the cold beans hit the roaster.


## [A Beginner’s Guide to Roasting Great Coffee at Home](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/05/a-beginners-guide-to-roasting-great-coffee-at-home/) (Tasmin Grant)

Home roasting will also help you broaden your coffee knowledge. You’ll start to understand what makes your favourite coffee taste so delicious and how you can alter your roast profile or buy different beans to highlight that. Through time and practice, your palate will improve – allowing you to appreciate your coffee even more.

Green, unroasted coffee beans have a significant amount of water retention. It would be impossible to grind and brew them. Nor would you want to: they have a distinctive grassy flavour.

Roasting kickstarts various chemical reactions, resulting in the development of more appetising flavours and aromas.

It’s when the beans start to darken, which is known as the browning stage, that the most important chemical reactions happen: the Maillard reaction, caramelisation, and Strecker degradation. These create many of the flavour and aroma compounds, including those responsible for sweetness and fruity acidity.

The browning stage ends with first crack, which is when the pressure inside the coffee beans causes them to crack open. You’ll recognise it by a series of popping noises.

Eventually, all the water inside the beans evaporates and they reach second crack. The coffee steadily becomes darker and releases more carbon-like aromatics. The majority of the sugars break down, and as the roast progresses, the beverage will taste increasingly bittersweet with reduced acidity.

Light to medium roasts normally finish somewhere between first and second crack. Dark roasts typically finish after second crack.

There are several ways to home roast coffee, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. To choose between them, consider how much money you are willing to spend, how much coffee you will roast, and how much control you want over your roasting variables.

Don’t be married to your roast time; you may need to change it at times. For example, roasting outside can mean your machine needs longer to warm up. Failing to adjust to this could lead to underdeveloped, under-roasted beans.

The batch size can also affect the roast time and ideal temperature. Evan says, “You may be using such a large batch that the beans won’t absorb heat evenly in the roaster. Or, you may be roasting so fast that not all the beans are able to achieve a proper level of browning.

“Try balancing your batch size and heat application until you get a long enough development time to even out your roast. If your roast time is very long, and the coffee is still uneven, try reducing your batch size!”

Using the highest temperature setting to achieve a faster roast time can result in scorched beans.

Stay consistent with your variables so you can better understand the impact they have. Try altering just one factor at a time to see what happens and how it affects the coffee’s flavours and aromas.

Roast a wide variety of coffee origins, varieties, and processes so that you can better understand your capabilities. Something that might not have a significant impact on a Guatemalan coffee might dramatically alter the profile of a Rwandan.


## [Physical changes coffee beans experience during roasting](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2019/03/what-happens-during-coffee-roasting-the-physical-changes/) (Veronica Belchior)

Roasters often keep track of percent weight loss to help identify which batches might deserve extra scrutiny in quality assurance.

Coffee beans have some of the strongest cell walls in the plant kingdom. They have external rings that reinforce the cell, increasing its stiffness and strength.

Roasting also increases porosity, making the beans less dense and much more soluble. This, of course, is vital to making them into a delicious drink.

The lipids help to keep volatile compounds inside the cell. Volatile compounds are chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature, some of which are essential to creating the flavor and aroma of coffee. Without the oils, they might disperse.

But whatever roast profile you choose, there are three main phases: drying, browning or the Maillard reaction, and development. These popular terms actually describe different stages of chemical and physical changes.

When you see the coffee beans start to turn brown, the Maillard reaction has started. This happens at around 150°C/302°F.

After first crack, the roast changes from an endothermic reaction (the beans absorb heat from the drum) to an exothermic one (the beans release heat).


## [What Happens During Coffee Roasting: The Chemical Changes](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2019/03/what-happens-during-coffee-roasting-the-physical-changes/) (Veronica Belchior)

The change in color is due to the production of melanoidins. These are large molecules that not only turn the beans brown, but contribute to mouthfeel and body.

Small changes in the temperature and length of time spent in the Maillard reaction can have a big impact on the final profile of a coffee.

Coffee that has spent longer in the Maillard reaction has been reported to have an increase in viscosity. A shorter Maillard duration can create more perception of sweetness and acidity. This is in part because the acids that produce fruity and sweet notes are destroyed if the coffee remains in the Maillard reaction for too long.

When roasters experiment with roast profiles, it includes varying the length and intensity of Maillard reaction and recording its effects on profile.

In general, volatile compounds are responsible for aroma and some non-volatile ones contribute to flavor.

Many non-volatile compounds contribute to flavor and profile. Examples include caffeine, which is responsible for some bitter flavors. Caffeine is naturally occurring in coffee and remains unchanged by the roasting process.

For example, the citric and tartaric acids that produce fruity and sweet notes are broken down during roasting so a long or overly hot roast can hugely reduce the sweetness of the final profile.


## [Acidic Coffees: A Brew & Roast Guide](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2018/05/why-are-some-coffees-more-acidic-than-others-a-brew-roast-guide/) (Fernando Pocasangre)

Because, as Mané says, “acidity can complement or unbalance the harmony of a coffee cup. If a coffee is more acidic it can become sour, people don’t like the coffee.” And without acidity? “Then the coffee will taste ‘flat.’”

Organic acids include citric, malic, quinic, acetic, succinic, and tartaric acids. These are the “good,” fruity acids that you want to taste in the cup.

Malic acid is the same kind of acid that you get in green apples, so think brewed coffee with the juiciness and smooth sharpness of green apples.

According to Mané, each origin has a “certain type of soil characteristics and a certain amount of a certain acid.”

The Arabica species, for example, tends to have less chlorogenic acids which decreases its perceived acidity. Certain varieties, such as the SL-28 that you’ll find in Kenya, are more acidic. Part of this is just genetics. Yet part of it is also because of the farming conditions. Certain varieties are more suited to being grown in cooler temperatures than others – and that also has an impact on the flavor.

Coffee that is grown at cooler temperatures tends to ripen slower, allowing the development of more complex flavors. When brewed, it tends to be more acidic and aromatic than those coffees grown in warmer climates – say, lower down the same mountain.

For example, wet/washed coffees are pulped and rinsed in water, removing layers of sucrose and fructose content. This allows the acidity to shine, unfiltered by that sweetness. On the other hand, naturally processed coffees leave the fruit intact while the coffee dries, increasing the overall sweetness and overpowering the perceived acidity.

You cannot create a flavor, in roasting or brewing, that a coffee doesn’t have. However, you can roast it in a way that will highlight or obscure the acidity.

But roasting isn’t just about how long you keep the beans in the roaster. It’s about how you manipulate the heat and airflow throughout to enhance the coffee’s best characteristics.

The softer the bean – which tends to correlate with higher farm temperatures – the gentler you’ll need to be with the heat.

Your aim should be an early first crack that doesn’t last too long – something that goes hand-in-hand with high heat. But don’t forget, too early or too short will also lead to sourness.

Try roasting and cupping your coffee with different development times and profiles. This should give you a better understanding of how your roast profile affects the coffee’s acidity. The more you do this, the more insights you will get!

the moment the water makes contact with your coffee, the flavor and aroma compounds begin to diffuse into the water – this is extraction.

The degree of extraction will affect the flavors and aromas in the cup, since not all compounds are extracted at the same time.

Fruity and acidic notes are extracted first, followed by sweetness and balance, and then finally bitterness. This means that under-extracting will lead to a sour taste, as it doesn’t have the sweetness and slight hint of bitterness necessary to balance the acidity. But over-extracting will taste bitter, as the sweetness and acidity will be overwhelmed. You want the perfect balance.

The finer the grind size, the more quickly extraction happens (note: extraction time is different to brew time). A coarse grind size means more acidity; a fine grind size, more bitterness. The longer the brew time, the more time extraction will happen. Short brews are more acidic; longer ones, more bitter. The hotter the water, the more quickly the extraction will happen – but too cool a water temperature and the acids won’t extract.

So, aim for a relatively high water temperature but a coarser grind size and shorter brew time for a more acidic cup. Grind finer and brew for longer if it’s coming out sour. Or, brew cool to avoid acids – but don’t forget that you’ll need to increase your brew time, since extraction takes longer at lower temperatures.


## [A Roaster’s Guide to Creating Coffee Blends](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2018/05/a-roasters-guide-to-creating-coffee-blends/) (Angie Katherine Molina Ospina)

The golden rule of coffee blends is that they should be better than the coffees were individually. Often, combining them adds greater balance and complexity, while highlighting the best notes of each component coffee.

The mid-palate is the moment between the first sip and the swallow – in other words, the majority of the consumer’s coffee-drinking experience. Beverages that are dissatisfying during the mid-palate are often called “hollow”.

A sweet base note: For this, she tells me that you need a coffee that takes on browning flavours well.

High notes: This comes from the kinds of coffees that can be roasted light, even though you don’t have to be crafting a light blend. We’re talking citric acidity and floral notes,


## [Blending Coffee Through Molecular Analysis](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2018/07/blending-coffee-through-molecular-analysis/) (Michael Beermann)

Previously published scientific papers show that green coffee beans contain a high concentration of sucrose. In the early stages of the roasting process, this sucrose is transformed to flavor molecules which are often linked to the sour and bitter taste of coffee.

Several studies indicate that sucrose makes a coffee’s bitter and sour notes seem milder and sweeter.

Two of our pre-selected acids, citric and malic, are responsible for flavors we often associate with lemons and apples respectively. In coffee, they are said to be among the main contributors to a sharp, fruity acidity. And these are the types of acid we wanted.

Chlorogenic acid can contribute to coffee body, despite having a somewhat unpleasant sour taste described as “green” or grassy. Quinic acid is often correlated with a bitter and astringent taste in coffee.

In green coffee beans, both chlorogenic and quinic acid have been associated with commercial-grade coffee. This suggests that a reduced concentration of them results in higher-quality green and roasted coffee. This is the type of acid we wanted to avoid.

We consistently found that blends with more fumaric acid had a fresh, crisp, sour flavor reminiscent of vinegar. Blind cuppings supported this.

Coffee’s most famous molecule, it’s what makes you feel awake and energized. But when it comes to flavor, caffeine is reported to have a strong, bitter taste. In fact, caffeine has been found to be a significant contributor to the bitterness which forms our perception of the coffee’s “strength” (although it’s certainly not the only factor).

While bitterness wasn’t our goal, it was vital to have a little of it for balance. Many people will associate a certain amount of bitterness with a good cup of coffee.


## [Honey processing: everything you need to know](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2015/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-honey-processing/) (Robbie Lynch)

The world’s most popular coffee processing methods are natural, washed, and honey. Natural processed coffees are dried, hulled and milled. Washed (or wet) coffees are pulped and then fermented to remove the mesocarp (also known as mucilage) layer before being dried and milled. Honey processing bridges the gap between wet and natural coffees; the coffee cherry is pulped and then dried with the mucilage layer on the parchment.

The next stage is the most intricate and sensitive part of the process: the drying phase. You have to get the timing of this perfect. It’s crucial that you don’t dry the beans too quickly. If you do, the flavours won’t be converted from the mucilage to the bean. It’s also crucial that you don’t dry the beans too slowly. You need to be quick enough to avoid fermentation within the bean, otherwise you’ll end up with mouldy coffee.

The first thing the farmers do is pick only the ripest cherries from the trees. The beans are then pulped from their outer skin, and as mentioned above, left in a layer of mucilage. This mucilage layer contains a high amount of sucrose (sugar) and acids which is really the key of the honey process.

Honey processed coffees generally possess great sweetness and a balanced acidity with fruity undertones. The flavours are typically less powerful than natural processed coffee, but the clarity and definition of them is much clearer and more pronounced. Who doesn’t want that?


## [Britannica: coffee roasting](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coffee-roasting) (Nathan Myhrvold)

If the beans are chemically decaffeinated, roasting also removes all but trace amounts of the solvent residues.

Roasting results in a loss of weight between 14 and 23 percent, and the internal pressure of gas expands the coffee beans by 30–100 percent

Regardless of the method used, the coffee, after leaving industrial roasters, is rapidly cooled in a vat, where it is stirred and subjected to cold air propelled by a blower. Good-quality coffees are then sorted by electronic sorters to eliminate those beans, either too light or too dark, that roasted badly and whose presence downgrades the overall quality.


## [How To Roast Coffee Beans: The Ultimate Guide](https://burmancoffee.com/coffee-roasting-etc/how-to-roast-coffee-beans-ultimate-guide/)

Just as apples are red and oranges are orange, coffee beans are green when they are removed from the fruit of the tree.

Arabica beans are known to have a sweet fruity taste with higher acidity. Robusta beans are known to have a flatter, bitter taste with lower acidity compared to Arabica beans. They also have a relatively higher caffeine concentration.

Because the Arabica variety is considered to be premium coffee beans, they are further classified into five grades. These grades are primarily based on the number of defects found per pound of beans.

The more economical Robusta beans are used in instant coffees, espresso, and as a filler in ground coffee.

Purchasing one pound of high premium green coffee beans from a coffee trader will cost less than one pound of garden-variety flavored roasted coffee beans from a coffee roaster or grocery store.

Raw or Green coffee beans have an estimated shelf life of three to four months compared to 15-20 days for roasted beans.

Body refers to the feeling on your tongue when drinking the coffee and is an imprecise measure of dissolved solids. Full-bodied coffee has a heavy, rich feel with an overlapping or complex variety of tastes. It will retain more of its flavor when diluted relative to a lighter body coffee. Lighter-bodied coffee is more diluted with little to no texture or residue left on your tongue.

“Perceived acidity” is the first impression of a cup of coffee – the crisp sensation hitting the tip of your tongue. Coffee beans’ growing regions, processing methods, and roast levels will affect the “perceived acidity” of the coffee, with darker roasts having a lower level, resulting in a flatter taste.

Note that the acidity being referred to is not to be confused with the chemical acidity (ph), although they are directly linked with one another.

### Different light coffee roast levels

Color/Appearance: Light Roast coffee beans are roasted a few minutes and become a brighter orange-brown color, dry with no visible oils. 
Time: The beans are roasted until the “first crack” is heard. Some of the lighter roasts in this category may have some beans remain uncracked. 
Taste: Despite the raw taste of light roast coffee beans, some coffee drinkers may choose this level of roasting for the higher level of antioxidants. Generally, coffees roasted to this level are higher in acidity and lighter in body and may taste harsh and underdeveloped.

### Different medium coffee roast levels

Color/Appearance: These coffee beans are medium brown and still exhibit a dry surface, though they may appear to have a slightly more velvety texture.
Time: Green coffee beans roasted until after the “first crack” but before the “second crack” are categorized as Medium Roast coffees. 
Taste: Relative to Light Roast coffees, they have sweeter tones and a more balanced body of acidity, aroma, and flavor. 

To create a flavorful cup of coffee with new unfamiliar beans, Medium Roast levels are a good place to start experimenting.

Moving on, slightly longer roast times and higher temperatures result in coffee beans producing a stronger aroma.

### Different medium dark coffee roast levels

Color/Appearance: Medium-Dark Roast coffee beans will be a rich, dark color and appear slightly shiny. 
Taste: Roasting to this level produces flavors leaning more toward spicy, chocolate, and dark berries. Coffee brewed with these beans will have a lower-acidity and a fuller body with abundant aromas and a drier finish, similar to baker’s chocolate or fine wine. 
Time: To achieve a lighter roast in this category, your green coffee beans will not quite have reached the “second crack”, while darker roasts will require roasting beyond the “second crack”.

### Different dark coffee roast levels

Color/Appearance: Spanish Roast coffee (far right above) will be charcoal black in color and oily to the touch. You will notice that the coffee beans will begin to smoke in the roaster as the sugars carbonize. 
Time: After the “second crack”, coffee beans will begin to darken very quickly.
Taste: Brewing with Dark Roast beans will produce a sweet smoky-tasting coffee with a lighter body, less acidity and the least caffeine of all roasts.

When stored in a cool, dry place in a sealed container, green coffee beans can last at least a year before losing any noticeable quality.

The ideal temperature is approximately 60°F at 60% humidity and no higher than 80°F. Higher humidity levels may lead to mold, while lower levels could cause the beans to dry out.

Don’t forget to periodically open the storage container and give the green coffee beans a shake to let air circulate over them. 

And remember, it is not necessary to freeze or refrigerate green coffee beans.

This is an important benefit as roasted coffee beans begin to deteriorate and lose its flavor in about six weeks.

Once you learn how to roast coffee, don’t forget this important step after the roasting process is complete. To maximize flavor, freshly roasted coffee should rest or “set up”. Resting time should last at least overnight and up to two to three days. You can rest the beans in an uncovered bowl or glass jar. This is also known as degassing your home roasted coffee beans. The degassing process should be done at room temperature with low humidity before preparing for longer-term storage.

Similar to raw coffee beans, roasted beans should be stored in a cool, dry, dark place. Make sure they are stored in a sealed container for longer-term storage. Avoid refrigerating or freezing your freshly roasted coffee beans. If you don’t, you can cause them to become too moist in the refrigerator or too dry in the freezer. In addition, there is the risk the beans will absorb the smells of foods. This can happen when they share the same space in a refrigerator or freezer. This will affect the ultimate taste of the coffee when it’s brewed.

We would like to add that roasting in a pan is totally doable, but it is challenging to get all the beans roasted to the same level. You will need to stir constantly! If you invest in a popcorn popper or automatic roasting machine, you will surely have more consistent results and much less work.

How long should you degassify roasted beans in an open bowl? If cooled beans are placed in the ziplock one way valve container, does that accomplish the same thing?
How do identify optimum degassing time?

Almost everyone agrees on 24 hours. From there, some like it fresher, some like to wait as long as 7-9 days before drinking. If you are ready to take the leap and make the investment, there are two two types  of home coffee roasters to consider – Fluid Bed and Drum. Fluid Bed Roasters are similar in design to hot-air popcorn poppers, roast small batches, and are easy to clean. Drum Roasters have a rotating screen drum allowing larger batches of coffee beans to roast more evenly. These coffee bean roasters give you a bit more control over the roasting process but require a larger investment. - Jon Burman (comments section)


## [How to Roast Coffee Beans in a Pan: Complete Guide](https://greatcoffeebrewers.com/how-to-roast-coffee-beans-in-a-pan/)

Select beans of uniform size and color to guarantee an equal, consistent roast and taste. To avoid uneven and disagreeable flavor, it’s critical to get these two factors right.

To get rid of any lingering scents or residue, boil water with detergent in a pan for 5-10 minutes and then rinse it. A cover isn’t necessary throughout the roasting process.

Stirring the beans is the most challenging and vital phase of the roasting process. The goal of mixing is to rotate the beans so that each side is uniformly roasted. Slow, purposeful stirring should keep the beans moving.

Depending on how black you want your coffee, it will take 8 to 10 minutes to roast. The beans start green, then turn yellow, light brown, and finally dark brown as they roast. If they begin to brown unevenly, reduce the heat and continue stirring until they reach a consistent hue.

After around 5 minutes, the beans will start to pop, similar to popcorn. This is known as the “first crack” in coffee roasting, and the beans are theoretically drinkable shortly after this stage.

Turn off the burner and spritz the coffee beans with a light mist of cold water. Since the beans will continue to cook until they’re warm, it’s critical to chill them immediately to avoid over roasting.

## [The Craft and Science of Coffee](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128035207/the-craft-and-science-of-coffee) (edited by Britta Folmer)

Coffee beans change color from greenish-gray-blue (color of the green bean) to yellow, orange, brown, dark brown, and finally to almost black. 

The structure of the coffee bean seems to be essential for the creation of the typical roast flavor of coffee. Experiments showed that ground green coffee powder exposed to similar temperature histories as in bean roasting does not produce the desired flavor compounds. The intact bean acts as an essential “minireactor” for the chemical reactions. 

By contrast to the popcorn roasting process with the sudden burst-type expansion, coffee beans swell continuously in a steady process 

The increasing gas pressure inside the bean is the main driving force for expansion, whereas the thick plant cell walls hold against it. 

According to glass transition theory, the polysaccharides of the cell walls may be in a “glassy” or “rubbery” state, depending on actual moisture content and temperature. 

The cell walls of coffee beans are unusually thick as compared to plant material of other species. 

Green coffee beans enter the roasting process with a typical moisture content of about 10–12% [g/100 g, wet base (wb)]. During roasting dehydration takes place. Depending on the roasting conditions the roasted beans may leave the process with a final moisture of about 2.5%. 

The highest rate of roast loss is usually found in the early process stages and is mainly caused by dehydration, whereas loss of organic matter is initiated later during the more advanced stages. 

Since green coffee in reality is always subject to natural quality fluctuations (e.g., fluctuating green coffee initial moisture content), the roast loss may also fluctuate from one batch to the next, even when roasted to the identical bean color. 

Coffee beans may contain up to 18% lipids (coffee oil). 

The gas pressure inside the bean pushes the coffee oil through tiny microchannels in the cell wall to the bean surface. 

Some of the most important chemical reactions affecting carbohydrates include Maillard reaction, Strecker degradation, pyrolysis, and caramelization. 

During the initial stages of roasting a considerable energy input is required to drive the evaporation of water and to induce chemical reactions (endothermic phase). At one point during roasting, the energy balance of chemical reactions becomes autocatalytic (exothermic). The beans eventually start to generate heat on their own ( Raemy and Lambelet, 1982 ). 

Roasting needs to be stopped abruptly at the desired degree of roast with an efficient precooling or cooling step. If roasting continues in an uncontrolled way the beans may catch fire and produce unsafe conditions in a roaster. 

The predominant gas formed upon roasting is carbon dioxide (CO2). Other important components include CO and N2. One part of the gas is released to the atmosphere during roasting. Another major part remains entrapped inside the beans and is only released later during storage in a slow desorption process and during subsequent processing steps (e.g., grinding). 

Gas measurements and model calculations come to the conclusion that the gas pressure inside the bean upon roasting may exceed values higher than 10 bars ( Schenker, 2000 ). 

some minor structural break down and cracks occur during the final roasting stages, releasing a tiny quantity of gas in a sudden microburst and manifest in cracking and popping sounds. 

The volatile fraction of roasted coffee is highly complex and consists of more than 1000 compounds. Much scientific work has been devoted to the identification of key aroma impact compounds ( Grosch, 2001 ; Poisson et al., 2014 ), 

The formation kinetics of aroma compounds during roasting is determined by the specific conditions for chemical reactions (e.g., temperature, water activity, pressure) as controlled by the process parameters (e.g., heat transfer over time). Therefore, different time–temperature conditions during roasting lead to specific flavor profiles obtained from the same raw material. 

The first roasting stage does not produce large aroma quantities, but may be important for the formation of aroma precursors. A majority of aroma compounds showed the highest formation rate at medium stages of the roasting process and medium stages of bean dehydration with the water content ranging from 7% to 2% (wb). The majority of important aroma compounds (e.g., most pyrazines) start to decay at high temperature during advanced stages of the process due to thermal degradation. The concentrations of these volatiles decrease with increasing degree of roast. By contrast, a limited number of aroma compounds continue to be created at high temperature (e.g., guaiacol). 

As a rule of thumb, increasing degree of roast leads to decreasing acidity and increasing bitterness. Therefore, selecting the optimal degree of roast is crucial for a balanced taste profile. 

Although caffeine—which is present in the green bean—has a strong bitter taste, it contributes only some 10–20% to the sensory perceived bitterness in coffee. 

The main contributors to bitterness are formed by roasting. The class of chlorogenic acid lactones—a break down product of chlorogenic acids—has been identified as one of the main contributors to bitterness in coffee ( Hofmann, 2008 ). 

Moderate quantities of quenching water will not affect the flavor or the physical bean properties. By contrast, excessive amount of quenching water will result in water absorption and therefore increase the final bean moisture. Hence, water quenching may also be used to adjust and control the final bean moisture. High water activity in the roasted bean results in an accelerated staling process and may affect flavor stability and shorten the product shelf-life. 

Very simplified, the pleasant and delightful coffee aroma builds up to a certain optimal degree of roast, but then decreases again upon continued roasting. In a similar way the sensory attribute “body” or “mouthfeel” increases to a certain point and then decreases on continued roasting beyond this point. An over-roasted coffee may yield strong intensity of “roasty note” at cup tasting, but very often lacks “body” and produces a sensory perception known as “thin” or “weak mouthfeel.” Depending on the origin and characteristics of green beans, different degrees of roast are required to exploit the natural flavor potential to its best. 

Comparing beans of identical degree of roast, fast roasted beans generate larger gas quantities than slow roasted beans. 

For a given bean color, fast roasted beans exhibit much greater bean volume and porosity and lower density than slow roasted beans. 

In general, more soluble matter can be extracted from fast roasted beans. This may be due to greater generation of soluble matter or to better accessibility for the water in high porosity structure or to both. 

Fast roasted beans finish the roasting process with a slightly higher final moisture content. 

Fast roasted beans exhibit also a considerably stronger tendency for oil sweating. 

Although the overall flavor intensity may be stronger for fast roasted beans compared to slow roasted beans of identical color, it does not mean that the cup profile is necessarily better. 

The same aroma impact compounds are formed regardless of the roasting time. However, the quantities of individual compounds or compound groups depend on the roasting time in various ways. 

Some aroma compounds are preferably generated in fast roasting conditions whereas others are enhanced at slow roast conditions. 

Fast roasted coffee usually delivers more acidity in the cup profile and often a stronger “roasty” note. Slow roasted coffees often show higher intensity in sensory attributes such as “balanced,” “fruity,” “nut-like,” and “toasty” notes. 

One possible problem that may occur in extreme cases of fast roasting is related to the heat transfer within the bean. 

In the cup profile this could lead to “burnt” notes and “greenish” notes at the same time. 

Changes in bean color, size, and texture are most notable during the process, and the aroma that the beans emit at each try should be correlated to the stages of roast as well. 

As a beginner or apprentice, the artisan must become familiar with the impact each adjustment has on the roast, and by extension, the cup quality. Here, as with all other players in the seed to cup chain, tasting the cup is crucial to the success of the endeavor. A well-developed palate, combined with an understanding of the machine and a unique point of view, will set an apprentice operator on the path to artisan. 

Before the tasting can begin, an artisan must rely heavily on their senses of sight and smell as the coffee progresses in the roaster. 

Data logging of temperature from a bean probe and time intervals, as well as the first and temperature of first crack is highly recommended. 

The roast plan and intended outcome are commonly referred to as the “profile.” A profile can mean both the course of development for the beans inside the roasting machine and the intended flavor characteristics realized in the cup. 

During the beans' first cracking point, which is marked by a sound similar to crackling or the sound of popcorn popping, the artisan can enjoy the initial aromas of true coffee character and observe the smoothing of the once dense and uneven bean surface texture. 

The first crack of the roast also corresponds to the beans' switch from endothermic to exothermic and so the artisan might make an adjustment to flame, and log it to finesse the roasting environment's rate of heat rise. 

The sense of sight and smell become increasingly more crucial after first crack as this is when the artisan must decide on, and execute, the correct drop time at the desired temperature. 

The arguments for roasting each component of a blend separately are compelling, but those reasons may make sense only as theory. It could be that the color variations and slightly uneven development resulting from a green blended coffee imparts the flavors that are exactly what the artisan intended. 

However, roasting (see Chapter 11 ) is undoubtedly the most important factor in the coffee value chain where important physical and chemical changes lead to the development of the characteristic roasted coffee attributes ( Clarke, 1987 ). 

Green coffee is primarily composed of carbohydrates, nitrogen (N)-containing compounds (mainly proteins, trigonelline, and caffeine), lipids, organic acids, and water. 

The more complex aroma and overall flavor of Arabica coffee has been explained by its higher sucrose level ( Farah, 2012 ). 

The concentration of glucose and fructose rises in the early roasting stage due to the constant degradation of sucrose. Almost all free sugars are lost upon roasting due to Maillard reaction and caramelization, giving rise to water, carbon dioxide, color, aroma, and taste. 

About 12–24% of the polysaccharides are degraded in light roasted coffee, 35– 40% upon dark roasting. 

Polysaccharides do not seem to specifically contribute to aroma formation during roasting, but impart relevant organoleptic properties of the coffee brew, such as viscosity and mouth feel ( Redgwell et al., 2002 ). 

Free amino acids represent only less than 1% of green coffee, however, their importance for the final flavor of roasted coffee is high. They are key reaction partners in the Maillard chemistry as well as in the Strecker degradation to yield many potent odorants. 

Flavor consists of two distinct sensory modalities, i.e., the volatile aroma perceived nasally and the nonvolatile taste perceived in the oral cavity. 

As coffee flavor is composed of more than 1000 volatile and nonvolatile compounds, a sophisticated analytical approach is required combining sensory and instrumental evaluations to narrow down the number of relevant compounds to focus on. 

The aroma of green coffee is described as green, hay- and pea-like ( Gretsch et al., 1999 ), and the taste as sweet, astringent ( Viani and Petracco, 2007 ), which indeed is very different from the product after roasting. 

Green coffee beans contain about 300 volatiles in much lower concentrations compared to roasted coffee. 

The complex mixture and balance of the volatile fraction make up for only about 0.1% of the total roasted coffee weight, with single components ranging from parts per trillion (ppt) levels to higher part per million (ppm) levels, making it to one of the beverages with the richest and most complex flavor content ( Hertz-Schünemann et al., 2013 ). 

Meanwhile it is broadly accepted that it is not the number of components that defines the quality, intensity, or characteristic of the overall odor impression of a food stuff. Indeed, for only about 25–30 key odorants a contribution to the overall aroma of coffee has been evidenced ( Blank et al., 1992 ; Grosch, 1998 , 2001a ; Kerler and Poisson, 2011 ). 

Interestingly, a few to about 40 impact odorants were found in most of investigated foods, e.g. roasted beef ( Cerny and Grosch, 1992 ), red wine ( Frank et al., 2011 ), or chocolate ( Schnermann and Schieberle, 1997 ), though hundreds of volatiles were identified. In addition, only a limited number of genuine volatile compounds are spread in most of the food matrices and less than 3% of foodborne volatiles constitute the chemical odorant space ( Dunkel et al., 2014 ). 

Although caffeine—which is present in the green bean—has a strong bitter taste, it contributes only some 10–20% to the sensory-perceived bitterness in coffee. 

Furthermore, diketopiperazines (DKPs), condensation product of free amino acids, play a role in coffee bitterness. 

Basically, the Maillard reaction is an amino-catalyzed sugar degradation leading to aroma, taste, and color (melanoidins). Sucrose, the most abundant free sugar in green coffee beans, needs first to be decomposed into glucose and fructose by heat treatment to undergo Maillard-type reactions. 

The identification and formation pathways of bitterness components in roasted coffee have recently been elucidated. CGA lactones, breakdown products of CGA (CQAs), have been identified as one of the main contributors to bitterness in coffee. In addition hydroxylated phenylindanes have been reported as intense bitter-tasting compounds ( Frank et al., 2007 ). 

Most of the polymeric carbohydrates, lipids, caffeine, and inorganic salts survive the roasting process. Alkaloids such as caffeine are relatively stable and only trigonelline is partially degraded to volatile compounds ( Viani and Horman, 1974 

It was shown that roasting of green coffee powder and green coffee bean fragments was different from roasting of whole coffee beans ( Fischer, 2005 ). Indeed, the coffee bean can be seen as a pressurized reactor. 

Thus, the formation of coffee aroma cannot always be explained by model reaction systems, as the extreme reaction conditions during coffee roasting can lead to different reaction pathways. 

The quality of the green coffee is the main determinant of the aroma and taste developed during the roasting process, and it is a snapshot at a defined roasting degree. 

It seems obvious that the optimum degree of roast is a function of green bean origin, intended brewing method, and personal taste preference. 

The experienced coffee roaster knows that the aroma evolves from sweet, fruity, floral, bread, and nutty character in light roasts, through more complex aroma profiles in medium roast. Darker roast levels are characterized by cocoa, spicy, phenolic, ashy, pungent, and dark roast flavors. The bitter taste increases during roasting, whereas the acidity decreases during initial stages of roasting ( Fig. 12.5 ). 

Sucrose and free amino acids are immediately available and highly reactive. Their high reactivity is explained by the presence of a free functional amino group and the rapid thermal hydrolysis of sucrose into reducing sugars. Arabinose branches and CGA are degraded in a later stage. This delayed reactivity can be explained by the additional energy needed for depolymerization or hydrolysis to liberate the reactive functions. Other polymeric carbohydrates (i.e., galactans, mannans, and cellulose) or bound amino acids are less prone to hydrolysis and depolymerization, and thus only contribute at a later stage of roasting to the Maillard reaction ( Arya and Rao, 2007 ). 

Short-time roasting at high temperature has been shown to result in considerable differences in the physical properties and kinetics of aroma formation compared to long time roasting at lower temperatures ( Baggenstoss et al., 2008a ; Glöss et al., 2014 ). Fast roasting yields more soluble solids while causing less degradation of CGA, and lower loss of volatiles ( Nagaraju et al., 1997 ). This is accentuated in higher quantities of roasty, buttery diketones, and furfurals, whereas much lower concentrations of phenols are formed, leading to less burnt, smoky flavor. On the other side, fast roasted coffee is presumed to be more affected by lipid oxidation due to higher oil migration from the inner bean to the surface ( Schenker et al., 2000 ). 

Green Arabica coffee contains more oligosaccharides, lipids, trigonelline, and organic acids. On the other hand, Robusta is significantly richer in caffeine and CGA and also exhibit a larger amount of free amino acids than Arabica (see also Table 12.3 ). 

Steam treatment of green coffee beans represents a method to improve flavor quality of Robusta coffees ( Becker et al., 1989 ; Darboven, 1995 ). They get sweeter, more acidic, and less bitter than untreated coffee, lowering significantly the Robusta character ( Theurillat et al., 2006 ). 

It seems that a higher air-to-bean ratio leads to a rather less complex and flat flavor, which was linked to an increased aroma stripping at higher air flows. 

The major compositional changes and chemical processes are summarized below that affect the development of flavor compounds in coffee upon roasting:

 - Loss of water: drying of the bean, low moisture reaction system;
 - Release of carbon dioxide: expansion of the bean;
 - Migration of lipids to the bean surface: retaining aroma components generated;
 - Loss of sugars (including sucrose): flavor and color formation (Maillard chemistry and caramelization);
 - Decrease of free amino acids: flavor and color formation (Maillard and Strecker chemistry);
 - Partial decomposition of polysaccharides (e.g., arabinogalactan): release of arabinose which in turn reacts leading to flavor formation (e.g., Maillard reaction);
 - Partial decomposition of proteins: release of amino acids which in turn reacts leading to flavor formation (e.g., Maillard reaction);
 - Loss of CGA: formation of bitter taste and color;
 - Decrease of trigonelline: formation of N-containing products (aroma, taste, color);
 - Formation of melanoidins: color formation (polymerization of polysaccharides, proteins, and polyphenols);
 - Partial lipid degradation: aroma active aldehydes.

The complexity of the green coffee composition as well as the chemical and physical transformations of the bean during roasting are difficult to reproduce in model systems. The approach of in-bean experiments using green beans as minireactors is a more realistic reaction environment.
