title: "Sobre Nosso Déficit de Atenção"
---
Como sociedade produtiva estamos doentes, mas apenas constatar este fato não é o suficiente para começarmos a nos tratar. Nós sabemos os sintomas e a causa. A causa é a evolução tecnológica se aproveitando de nossas falhas biológicas por grandes corporações para vender anúncios. Ironicamente existe uma análise [] feito por Tristan Harris, um ex-eticista do Google e filósofo, que relaciona a "indústria da atenção" com a de alimentos, que manipula sal, açúcar e outros para manipular nossa tendência a esses sabores. Essa nova indústria utiliza o funcionamento de nosso mecanismo de recompensa para fazer-nos cada vez mais checar o email e notificações quando estamos entediados, em um sistema de feedback positivo cujo final é não termos mais paciência para a realidade e não conseguirmos mais parar de navegar pela infinitas luzes piscantes nas telas de nossos celulares.

No livro [Deep Work], de Cal Newport, o autor apresenta uma defesa de que estão sumindo as pessoas com a habilidade de conseguir focar por muito tempo em uma tarefa difícil. Três trabalhos citados, de William Powers [], John Freemans [] e Alex Soojung-Kin [], concordam que ferramentas de networking estão nos distraindo do trabalho e requisitando nossa atenção, ao mesmo tempo que degradando nossa capacidade de permanecer focado.

A causa biológica entre os cientistas parece estar chegando em um consenso. A resposta estaria ligada à mielina (...)

    As the journalist Daniel
    Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code, these
    scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelin
    —a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting
    like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and
    cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in improvement,
    keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical,
    eventually reduce down to brain circuits. This new
    science of performance argues that you get better at a skill
    as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons,
    allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more
    effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to
    be well myelinated.
    This understanding is important because it provides a
    neurological foundation for why deliberate practice
    works. By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re
    forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and
    again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit
    triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping
    layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—
    effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why
    it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while
    avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to
    isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful
    myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn a
    complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a
    state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your
    Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits
    simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of
    neurons you actually want to strengthen.
    In the century that has passed since Antonin-Dalmace
    Sertillanges first wrote about using the mind like a lens to
    focus rays of attention, we have advanced from this
    elevated metaphor to a decidedly less poetic explanation
    expressed in terms of oligodendrocyte cells. But this
    sequence of thinking about thinking points to an
    inescapable conclusion: To learn hard things quickly, you
    must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other
    words, is an act of deep work. If you’re comfortable going
    deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly
    complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our
    economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom
    depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you
    shouldn’t expect these systems and skills to come easily to
    you.
    
Outra pesquisa a respeito de ambientes com interrupções ser prejudicial para a produtividade.

    It’s bad enough that so many trends are prioritized
    ahead of deep work, but to add insult to injury, many of
    these trends actively decrease one’s ability to go deep.
    Open offices, for example, might create more
    opportunities for collaboration,
    * but they do so at the cost
    of “massive distraction,” to quote the results of
    experiments conducted for a British TV special titled The
    Secret Life of Of ice Buildings. “If you are just getting
    into some work and a phone goes off in the background, it
    ruins what you are concentrating on,” said the
    neuroscientist who ran the experiments for the show.
    “Even though you are not aware at the time, the brain
    responds to distractions.”
    Similar issues apply to the rise of real-time messaging.
    E-mail inboxes, in theory, can distract you only when you
    choose to open them, whereas instant messenger systems
    are meant to be always active—magnifying the impact of
    interruption. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the
    University of California, Irvine, is an expert on the science
    of attention fragmentation. In a well-cited study, Mark and
    her co-authors observed knowledge workers in real
    offices and found that an interruption, even if short, delays
    the total time required to complete a task by a significant
    fraction. “This was reported by subjects as being very
    detrimental,” she summarized with typical academic
    understatement.
