title: Calisthenics for Beginners by Matt Schifferle
---

Agora que [a fase de entrevistas] está terminando meu próximo item da lista de leitura é este livro de Matt Schifferle que foca em exercícios que utilizam o próprio peso do corpo e uma abordagem avessa às complicações dos treinos de academia.

Schifferle à primeira vista lembra Mistery, o guru das conquistas de [The Pick Up Artist]. Ambos acreditam em suas filosofias para transformar a vida de seus seguidores. Será que ambos utilizam alquimia dentro dos conceitos que meu amigo me ensinou quando conversávamos sobre as definições instigantes de Timothy Leary (não me lembro se isso está em Prometheus Rising).

# Recortes

> Calisthenics has a transformative power that many athletes fail to recognize: the power to harness the very laws of nature to substantially improve your health.

> I’m truly excited to present you with not only a body-changing but also a potentially life-changing training regimen.

> (...) calisthenics went from being too easy to far too difficult. Neither perception will help you accomplish your goals. That’s why it’s essential to wipe the slate clean. You can define what calisthenics is for you and your life.

> The highly adaptable nature of calisthenics is due to the fact that your own body is your gym. You no longer have to conform your body to an artificial piece of equipment. Instead, you use your body—and its current abilities—to stimulate your improvement.

> Mother Nature is the ultimate nutritionist.

> Granted, it takes practice to accurately read your body’s natural signals. For example, it’s easy to believe you’re hungry when, in fact, you’re bored or stressed. It’s also easy to ignore your satiety cues if you’re eating while distracted like while watching a movie. Nevertheless, you have plenty of opportunities to practice every day, and, over a short period of time, you can develop a keen sense of what your body really needs.

> Customize the stoplight strategy to your needs and preferences. Keep in mind that one person’s red light food may be another’s yellow or even green light food.
