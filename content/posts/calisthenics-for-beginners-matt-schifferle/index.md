title: Calisthenics for Beginners by Matt Schifferle
---

Agora que [a fase de entrevistas] está terminando meu próximo item da lista de leitura é este livro de Matt Schifferle que foca em exercícios que utilizam o próprio peso do corpo e uma abordagem avessa às complicações dos treinos de academia.

Schifferle à primeira vista lembra Mistery, o guru das conquistas de [The Pick Up Artist]. Ambos acreditam em suas filosofias para transformar a vida de seus seguidores. Será que ambos utilizam alquimia dentro dos conceitos que meu amigo me ensinou quando conversávamos sobre as definições instigantes de Timothy Leary (não me lembro se isso está em Prometheus Rising)? Não. Schifferle é um vendedor de mais uma forma de fazer exercício como qualquer outro treinador.

No entanto, suas críticas sobre exercícios serem mais difíceis do que precisam é pertinente. O miolo de seu livro é um conjunto de exercícios simples de seguir. No entanto, não há uma estrutura para que leigos consigam criar seus próprios treinos como prometido pela capa. É um bom início ao treinamento da calestenia, mas para por aí. Sua filosofia é muito senso comum sem nenhum insight poderoso. Seu jeito de falar me desanima por ser simplista demais. Não há um gancho que seja forte para capturar nossa atenção.

Admiro sua intenção, contudo.

# Recortes

> Calisthenics has a transformative power that many athletes fail to recognize: the power to harness the very laws of nature to substantially improve your health.

> I’m truly excited to present you with not only a body-changing but also a potentially life-changing training regimen.

> (...) calisthenics went from being too easy to far too difficult. Neither perception will help you accomplish your goals. That’s why it’s essential to wipe the slate clean. You can define what calisthenics is for you and your life.

> The highly adaptable nature of calisthenics is due to the fact that your own body is your gym. You no longer have to conform your body to an artificial piece of equipment. Instead, you use your body—and its current abilities—to stimulate your improvement.

> Mother Nature is the ultimate nutritionist.

> Granted, it takes practice to accurately read your body’s natural signals. For example, it’s easy to believe you’re hungry when, in fact, you’re bored or stressed. It’s also easy to ignore your satiety cues if you’re eating while distracted like while watching a movie. Nevertheless, you have plenty of opportunities to practice every day, and, over a short period of time, you can develop a keen sense of what your body really needs.

> Customize the stoplight strategy to your needs and preferences. Keep in mind that one person’s red light food may be another’s yellow or even green light food.

> Liquid sources. The first tip is to cut back on or, if possible, eliminate calories from liquid sources. It’s exceptionally easy to add extra calories, especially in the form of refined sugar, with beverages. Some beverages contain more sugar than multiple candy bars! Thankfully, as liquid calories make it easy to bloat your diet, they also make it easy to slim your diet by cutting them back as much as possible. Whole foods. The second tip is to focus on whole foods, including plant and protein sources. Whole foods are the opposite of refined foods; they fill you up, give you energy, and make it much harder to consume more calories than your body can handle. That’s a heck of a 1-2-3 punch for helping you shed fat fast. Portion control. A lot of weight control also boils down to portion control. On a fundamental level, your body uses your fat when you don’t consume enough to support your current bodyweight. This is why you want to make sure you’re not eating too much, even if your diet is squeaky clean.

> It’s important that you eat even when trying to lose weight. Eating too little for days on end can make you feel tired and sluggish, not to mention leave you open to hunger cravings. Such conditions not only reduce your ability to burn calories through activity but also make you vulnerable to periods of overeating.

> Our busy lives make it all too tempting to finish a workout, and then rush to complete the next item on our to-do list. I don’t recommend ending your workout in such a sudden manner. When you finish your workout without winding down, your nervous system remains in sympathetic dominance, which promotes your body’s fight-or-flight instincts—a stressful state in which to spend the rest of your day.

> Sleep is the biggest component of rest. It’s so important that I often tell people that improving their sleep habits can be more beneficial to their fitness goals than improving their diet and exercise program combined. Getting proper sleep should always be as high a priority as sticking to your diet and exercise habits. If you’re struggling to make progress and running on little rest, I promise getting enough sleep will help.
