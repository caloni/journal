# The Mechanics of Emotion  (instapaper.com)

> A non-trivial portion of your emotional state is a signal describing your mind's assessment of 'the structure of possibility' of your reality model.

> Emotion expands the relevant context.

> The more emotionally charged a discussion gets, the broader the subject of discussion tends to become.

> Emotional intensity corresponds to the magnitude of divergence of conceptual models.

> Political and religious arguments become emotionally intense quickly because the political and religious aspects of a person's reality model can often have very large-scale structural implications.


# Negative Emotions Are Key to Well-Being  (scientificamerican.com)

> 'Remember, one of the primary reasons we have emotions in the first place is to help us evaluate our experiences,' Adler says.

> Instead of backing away from negative emotions, accept them. Acknowledge how you are feeling without rushing to change your emotional state. Many people find it helpful to breathe slowly and deeply while learning to tolerate strong feelings or to imagine the feelings as floating clouds, as a reminder that they will pass.

> I often tell my clients that a thought is just a thought and a feeling just a feeling, nothing more.


# To Stop Procrastinating, Start by Understanding the Emotions Involved: psychology  (reddit.com)

> Instead of looking for a new job, he might go to the gym'a move researchers call 'moral compensation.' That is when procrastinators do something to make themselves feel good or productive in order to avoid the task that needs to get done.

> In addition, procrastinators often seem unable to see as clearly into the future about their choices and behaviors as non-procrastinators'a phenomenon she calls 'temporal myopia.' Their vision of their future selves is often more abstract and impersonal, and they're less connected emotionally to their future selves. Temporal myopia may be largely due to their high levels of stress which can shift their focus to more immediate rather than distant concerns.

# Flow (psychology) - Wikipedia (wikipedia.org)

> Flow shares many characteristics with hyperfocus . However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. Some examples include spending "too much" time playing video games or getting side-tracked and pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. 

> The flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the "optimal experience" in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience. 


# Optimizing Your Development Environment (www.mpscholten.de)

> It is fair to say that when you are programming and not in flow, you are wasting time. 

> If your application always needs 30 seconds to build you will get distracted during these 30 seconds. 

> Slow feedback can really destroy your performance, so make sure you are never waiting for your computer. 

> If the unit tests are not running fast you will just push your commits. 

> A great way to increase productivity is to transform the non-automated processes into automated processes. 

> A good way to increase productivity is to make bugs impossible by design. 

> Avoid bugs by design to avoid spending too much time on fixing them.

# tantek / WillpowerImprovement (pbworks.com)

> "the brain has a limited capacity for self-regulation, so exerting willpower in one area often leads to backsliding in others" "brain's store of willpower is depleted when people control their thoughts, feelings or impulses, or when they modify their behavior in pursuit of goals"

> "people who successfully accomplish one task requiring self-control are less persistent on a second, seemingly unrelated task."

# Jessica Livingston's Pretty Complete List on How Not to Fail · The Macro (The Macro)

> My advice to those of you who are still looking for an idea is to solve a problem that you yourself have.

# "Scott Adams: How to Be Successful - WSJ  (online.wsj.com)"

> Let me start with some tips on what not to do. Beware of advice about successful people and their methods. For starters, no two situations are alike. Your dreams of creating a dry-cleaning empire won't be helped by knowing that Thomas Edison liked to take naps. Secondly, biographers never have access to the internal thoughts of successful people. If a biographer says Henry Ford invented the assembly line to impress women, that's probably a guess.

> "Follow your passion." That sounds perfectly reasonable the first time you hear it. Passion will presumably give you high energy, high resistance to rejection and high deterination. Passionate people are more persuasive, too. Those are all good things, right?

> Counterargument: When I was a commercial loan officer for a large bank, my boss taught us that you should never make a loan to someone who is following his passion.

> My boss, who had been a commercial lender for over 30 years, said that the best loan customer is someone who has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard at something that looks good on a spreadsheet.

> In hindsight, it looks as if the projects that I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success.

> Every time he got a new job, he immediately started looking for a better one. For him, job seeking was not something one did when necessary. It was a continuing process.

> Your job is not your job; your job is to find a better job.

> One should have a system instead of a goal.



# "The 10 commandments for happiness and success  (chentir.com)"

> Things like money and prestige are given too much importance to the detriment of focusing on what is really essential to us: living a life in line with our inner values, accomplishing valuable things.


# "Sleep Everything You Need To Know (The Healthy Life)"

> If you slept like crap, stay away from carbs the next day. 

> The later you go to sleep, the less Deep Sleep you get.

> Crucial for fact retention. While in Deep Sleep your mind replays your short term memories in the hippocampus. 


# "Technology is Heroin  (whattofix.com)"

> You would sit very attentively, absorbing each and every note and drumbeat of the symphony. It was a play, a painting, an imaginary world come to life, and you were living in it. It was magic.

> In rural America, it wasn¿t unusual to walk five miles to a friend¿s house to play a few games of checkers. Life was monotonous and physically challenging.

> You spent a lot of time hauling around water, chopping firewood, planting and tending crops. It took nearly continuous physical activity. Leisure was no different: it took time, work, and active minds.


# "News is bad for you and giving up reading it will make you happier"

> News is bad for your health. It leads to fear and aggression, and hinders your creativity and ability to think deeply. The solution? Stop consuming it altogether.


# "How to be a great software developer"

> Your seniority and value as a programmer is measured not in what you know, it¿s measured in what you put out.

> Your value is in how you move your project forward and how you empower your team to do the same.

> Simplicity is far more easily attained by time spent working and refactoring than hours of pure thought and ¿brilliance¿.

> Simplicity and excellence are most reliably attained by starting with something, anything, that gets the job done and reworking back from that point.

> Start with something ugly but functional and then apply and reapply yourself to that ugly and misshapen solution and refactor it back into its simplest form.

> Simplicity comes far more reliably from work than from brilliance. It comes more predictably from code written, than from thought expended. It comes from effort.



# "5 Unusual Ways to Start Working Smarter, Not Harder, Backed by Science"

> In one of my favorite books, Stephen Covey tells a story about a woodcutter whose saw gets more blunt as time passes and he continues cutting down trees. If the woodcutter were to stop sawing, sharpen his saw and go back to cutting the tree with a sharp blade, he¿d actually save time and effort in the long run.

> Sharpen the Saw means preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have¿you. It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual.

> On average, our brains are only able to focus for 90 minutes and need at least 20 minutes rest thereafter, if we consider our natural ultradian rhythms.


# "Best Writing Advice for Engineers I've Ever Seen. Period."

How to make engineers write concisely with sentences? By combining journalism with the technical report format. In a newspaper article, the paragraphs are ordered by importance, so that the reader can stop reading the article at whatever point they lose interest, knowing that the part they have read was more important than the part left unread.

State your message in one sentence. That is your title. Write one paragraph justifying the message. That is your abstract. Circle each phrase in the abstract that needs clarification or more context. Write a paragraph or two for each such phrase. That is the body of your report. Identify each sentence in the body that needs clarification and write a paragraph or two in the appendix. Include your contact information for readers who require further detail.


# "What You'll Wish You'd Known (paulgraham.com)"

> Which is an uncomfortable thought. If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. 

> I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right. 

> I think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway. 

> It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take. 

> The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense. 

> They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary. 

> If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question. 

> The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost. 

> Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first. If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another. Repeat till, like an internal combustion engine, the process becomes self-sustaining, and each project generates the next one. (This could take years.) 

> There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail. 

> The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn. 

> You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age. 

> The key to wasting time is distraction. Without distractions it's too obvious to your brain that you're not doing anything with it, and you start to feel uncomfortable. 

> Samuel Johnson said "no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money." 

> If a bunch of actual adults suddenly found themselves trapped in high school, the first thing they'd do is form a union and renegotiate all the rules with the administration. 


# "O Poder do Agora (Eckhart Tolle)"

> Embora eu continuasse vivendo normalmente, tinha percebido que nada que eu viesse a fazer poderia mudar realmente a minha vida. Eu já tinha tudo de que necessitava.

> Assim, vemos e julgamos o presente com os olhos do passado e construímos uma imagem totalmente distorcida.

> Em vez de ¿observar o pensador¿, podemos também criar um espaço no fluxo da mente, direcionando o foco da nossa atenção para o Agora. Torne-se consciente do momento. Isso é profundamente gratificante de se fazer. Agindo assim, desviamos a consciência para longe da atividade da mente e criamos um espaço de mente vazia, em que ficamos extremamente alertas e conscientes, mas sem pensar. Essa é a essência da meditação.

> Podemos sempre lidar com uma situação no momento em que ela se apresenta, mas não podemos lidar com algo que é apenas uma projeção mental.

> A nossa situação de vida existe no tempo. Nossa vida é agora. Nossa situação de vida é coisa da mente. Nossa vida é real.

> Ao dizer ¿não¿ a uma pessoa ou situação, você não deve reagir, mas sim agir de acordo com um insight, uma firme convicção do que é certo ou errado para você naquele momento. Permita que isso seja um ¿não¿ sem reação, um ¿não¿ de alta qualidade, um ¿não¿ livre de toda a negatividade e, desse modo, não gere mais sofrimento.

> Se você nunca consegue aceitar o que é, conseqüentemente não é capaz de aceitar qualquer pessoa do jeito que ela é. Você está sempre julgando, criticando, rotulando, rejeitando ou tentando mudar as pessoas.

> Quando se envolver em uma discussão ou um conflito com um sócio ou um amigo, observe como você se coloca na defensiva quando a sua própria posição é atacada, sinta a potência da sua própria agressão ao atacar a posição da outra pessoa.

> A presença remove o tempo. Sem o tempo, nenhum sofrimento e nenhuma negatividade conseguem sobreviver.

> Você quer ter uma morte fácil? Você prefere morrer sem sofrimento, sem agonia? Então, morra para o passado a cada instante e permita que a luz da sua presença apague o pesado e limitado ¿eu¿ que você pensou que era ¿você¿.

> Quer dizer que ninguém é responsável pelos atos que pratica? Não gosto dessa idéia. Se você é governado pela mente, embora não tenha escolha, vai sofrer as conseqüências da sua inconsciência e criar mais sofrimento. Você vai carregar o fardo do medo, das disputas, dos problemas e do sofrimento. Até que o sofrimento force você, no final, a sair do seu estado de inconsciência.



# "How to Beat Procrastination - Less Wrong (lesswrong.com)"

> My own behavior baffles me. I find myself doing what I hate, and not doing what I really want to do! - Saint Paul (Romans 7:15)

> Results from 39 procrastination studies show that low expectancy is a major cause of procrastination.

> This point may be obvious, but it¿s nice to see it confirmed in over a dozen scientific studies. We put off things we don¿t like to do.

> Dozens of studies have shown that procrastination is closely tied to impulsiveness.

> We are less motivated by delayed rewards than by immediate rewards, and the more impulsive you are, the more your motivation is affected by such delays.

> Set yourself up for success by doing things you know you can succeed at, again and again, to keep your confidence high.

> Steel recommends that for starters, ¿it is often best to have process or learning goals rather than product or outcome goals. That is, the goals are acquiring or refining new skills or steps (the process) rather than winning or getting the highest score (the product).¿

> After imagining what you want to achieve, mentally contrast that with where you are now.

> too much optimism about how long a task will take may cause you to put it off until the last minute, which turns out to be too late.

> It also helps to make sure tasks are connected to something you care about for its own sake,22 at least through a chain: you read the book so you can pass the test so you can get the grade so you can get the job you want and have a fulfilling career. Breaking the chain leaves a task feeling meaningless.

> Tackle tasks when you are most alert.

> Drink lots of water. Stop eating anything that contains wheat and other grains. Use drugs (especially modafinil) as necessary. Do short but intense exercise once a week. When tired, splash cold water on your face or take a shower or do jumping jacks or go running. Listen to music that picks up your mood. De-¿clutter your life, because clutter is cognitively exhausting for your brain to process all day long.

> One obvious way to inject more value into a task is to reward yourself for completing it.

> A warning: Don¿t try to be perfect. Don¿t try to completely eliminate procrastination. Be real. Overregulation will make you unhappy. You¿ll have to find a balance.

> Eliezer Yudkowsky claimed that ¿on a moment-¿to-¿moment basis, being in the middle of doing the work is usually less painful than being in the middle of procrastinating.¿

# "O cansaço mental (Ediciones El País)"

> Quando se vive em uma linha de pensamentos desnecessários e debilitantes, faz bem levantar algumas questões que ajudem a desativar esse mecanismo repetitivo e levem a uma reflexão mais produtiva e estimulante. Por exemplo, o que motiva a pensar no que se está pensando? O primeiro passo é encontrar o propósito, porque isso permite perceber a inutilidade desse pensamento e mudar de rumo. 

> Uma mente agradecida é uma mente descansada. 

> Quando a mente está livre de todo conflito, há uma energia criativa que surge livre de condicionamentos¿ 

> Às vezes planejamos algo, mas quando chega a hora sentimos que não é o momento, ou não é o nosso momento. É importante parar por alguns minutos para repensar. Esse intervalo cria um espaço mental para abrir um parêntese, enxergar e decidir com mais clareza. 

> Exercitar a mente com pensamentos criativos revitaliza. É como quando se faz exercício físico. Caminhar, correr, nadar ou jogar tênis nos energiza, e se nos cansamos, sentimos que é um cansaço sadio. Por outro lado, se ficamos em pé meia hora sem nos movermos, terminamos mais cansados do que se tivéssemos passado esse tempo caminhando. Acontece algo parecido com a mente: se ela está ¿parada¿, dando voltas num mesmo assunto, ela se esgota mais que quando avança com pensamentos inspiradores, que abrem novos horizontes. 

> São situações que ajudam a conter a atividade mental durante alguns minutos e descansar. Trata-se de visualizar um espaço que ajude a renovar o discernimento. 

> Na prática de meditação aconselha-se simplesmente a observar os pensamentos e deixá-los passar. Chega um momento em que a pessoa se dá conta de que são uma criação mental, um filme, que é possível deixar de criar e de acompanhar. 


# "How to Make Mistakes (ase.tufts.edu)"

> Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should become a connoisseur of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind as if they were works of art, which in a way they are.

> Mistakes are not just golden opportunities for learning; they are, in an important sense, the only opportunity for learning something truly new.

> The trick is to take advantage of the particular details of the mess you¿ve made, so that your next attempt will be informed by it, and not be just another blind stab in the dark. In which direction should the next attempt be launched, given that this attempt failed?

> over 90% of all the creatures that have ever lived died childless, but not a single one of your ancestors suffered that fate. Talk about a line of charmed lives!

> This, by the way, is what makes us so much smarter than every other species. It is not so much that our brains are bigger or more powerful, but that we share the benefits that our individual brains have won by their individual histories of trial and error. The secret is knowing when and how to make mistakes, so that nobody gets hurt and everybody can learn from the experience.

> We don¿t usually have to risk life and limb in order to learn from our mistakes, but we do have to keep track, and actually attend to them. The key to that is first, not to try to hide your mistakes.

> Second, you must learn not to deny to yourself that you have made them or try to forget them. That is not easy. The natural human reaction to mistake is embarrassment and anger, and you have to work hard to overcome these emotional reactions. Try to acquire the weird practice of savoring your mistakes, delighting in uncovering the strange quirks that led you astray.


# "A Model of Emotion (markpneyer.me)"

> Emotion expands the relevant context. The more emotionally charged a discussion gets, the broader the subject of discussion tends to become.

> Emotional intensity corresponds to the magnitude of divergence of conceptual models. Political and religious arguments become emotionally intense quickly because the political and religious aspects of a person¿s reality model can often have very large-¿scale structural implications.


# "10 Passos para a Estratégia Kaizen"

> Tiago Pimentel Kaizen de uma forma generalista quer dizer crescimento contínuo, gradual e sustentado, através de pequenas mudanças diárias. Nada de muito drástico. Mudanças simples e que lhe permitam conscientemente perceber que o dia de ¿hoje foi melhor que ontem e amanhã melhor que hoje.

> Descarte ideias fixas e convencionais, a própria ideia de Kaizen é pouco convencional, e a realidade é que possivelmente mais de 95% das pessoas não pratica ou treina o melhoramento contínuo.  As ideias fixas e convencionais são limitadoras e não estimulam o crescimento. Seja diferente e atinja a excelência.
