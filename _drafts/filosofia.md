# "Sophie's World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy (Jostein Gaarder)"

> We mustn't jump to conclusions. That is the only thing a real philosopher must never do.' 

> When we speak of the 'laws of nature' or of 'cause and effect,' we are actually speaking of what we expect, rather than what is 'reasonable.' The laws of nature are neither reasonable nor unreasonable, they simply are. 

> One of the main concerns of philosophy is to warn people against jumping to conclusions. It can in fact lead to many different forms of superstition.' 

> 'Whatever we see will first and foremost be perceived as phenomena in time and space. Kant called 'time' and 'space' our two 'forms of intuition.' And he emphasized that these two 'forms' in our own mind precede every experience. In other words, we can know before we experience things that we will perceive them as phenomena in time and space. For we are not able to take off the 'glasses' of reason.' 

> 'For the mind of man is not just 'passive wax' which simply receives sensations from outside. The mind leaves its imprint on the way we apprehend the world. You could compare it with what happens when you pour water into a glass pitcher. The water adapts itself to the pitcher's form. In the same way our perceptions adapt themselves to our 'forms of intuition.'' 

> According to Kant, there are two elements that contribute to man's knowledge of the world. One is the external conditions that we cannot know of before we have perceived them through the senses. We can call this the material of knowledge. The other is the internal conditions in man himself ' such as the perception of events as happening in time and space and as processes conforming to an unbreakable law of causality. We can call this the form of knowledge.' 

> 'So when you choose not to be mean ' even if it is against your own interests ' you are then acting freely.' 

> 'As material beings we belong wholly to the natural world. We are therefore subject to causal relations. As such, we have no free will. But as rational beings we have a part in what Kant calls das Ding an sich ' that is, the world as it exists in itself, independent of our sensory impressions. Only when we follow our 'practical reason' ' which enables us to make moral choices ' do we exercise our free will, because when we conform to moral law, it is we who make the law we are conforming to.' 

> 'Go ahead and make fun of me. All evening, I've been able to feel someone here.' 'One of us will have to swim out to it.' 'We'll both go, Dad.' 


# Simulation, Consciousness, Existence -- Hans Moravec, 1998 (cmu.edu)

A consciência pode ser primariamente essa estória contínua que contamos a nós mesmos, de momento a momento, sobre o que fizemos e por que nós o fizemos. A mente humana pode estar apenas interpretando seu próprio funcionamento como consciente, resgatando a si mesma da zumbilidade sem sentido, mas alguns humanos cientes apenas ocasionalmente das qualidades mais grosseiras do nosso ambiente imediato e nosso passado imediato são com certeza insuficientes para trazer todo o significado do universo visível.

# Objetivismo

## Ayn Rand

### crítica: [Why I Am Not an Objectivist (Michael Huemer)](http://www.owl232.net/rand.htm)

I say that reason does not only operate on input provided to it by other faculties, but is also a faculty of direct awareness of certain things - namely, all the things listed above. This knowledge that originates in reason is direct in the same sense that perceptions are direct knowledge. It is not innate, for the same reason that observations are not innate - it is acquired only by exercising the faculty (though the faculty is innate in both cases), and therefore not all the things in principle knowable by reason are actually known.

That these are universals is shown by the fac that they can have multiple instances.

> His face looked tanned by a summer sun, and his eyes were the exact color of the sky on the kind of day when he had acquired his tan. 

> 'So you think that money is the root of all evil?' said Francisco d'Anconia. 'Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil? 

> Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor'your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. 

> An honest man is one who knows that he can't consume more than he has produced. 

> Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men's stupidity, but your talent to their reason.

> 'Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth'the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. 

> Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. 

> Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich'will not remain rich for long. 

> Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot. 

> That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves'slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody's mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer. Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers'as industrialists. 

> 'If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose'because it contains all the others'the fact that they were the people who created the phrase 'to make money.' No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity'to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words 'to make money' hold the essence of human morality. 

> 'Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns'or dollars. Take your choice'there is no other'and your time is running out.' 

> There are no evil thoughts except one: the refusal to think. 

> 'You seem to be pleased about it.' 'Don't I have good reason to be?' 'But, after all, I did break one of your laws.' 'Well, what do you think they're for?' 

> 'Look around you,' he said. 'A city is the frozen shape of human courage'the 

> 'Do you think that it's any better in the West?' 'No. I don't.' 'Then why are you going there?' 'Because I haven't tried it before. That's all there is left to try. It's somewhere to go. Just to keep moving . . . You know,' he added suddenly, 'I don't think it will be any use. But there's nothing to do in the East except sit under some hedge and wait to die. I don't think I'd mind it much now, the dying. I know it would be a lot easier. Only I think that it's a sin to sit down and let your life go, without making a try for it.' 

> To work'on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you'll never see, whose needs you'll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question'just to work and work and work'and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This'a moral ideal? 

> She remembered that money inside a man's pocket had the power to turn into confidence inside his mind; she took a hundred-dollar bill from her bag and slipped it into his hand. 'As advance on wages,' she said. 

> 'Do you know that the United States is the only country in history that has ever used its own monogram as a symbol of depravity? Ask yourself why. Ask yourself how long a country that did that could hope to exist, and whose moral standards have destroyed it. It was the only country in history where wealth was not acquired by looting, but by production, not by force, but by trade, the only country whose money was the symbol of man's right to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to his happiness, to himself. If this is evil, by the present standards of the world, if this is the reason for damning us, then we'we, the dollar chasers and makers'accept it and choose to be damned by that world. We choose to wear the sign of the dollar on our foreheads, proudly, as our badge of nobility'the badge we are willing to live for and, if need be, to die.' 

> She smiled. 'I know, this is a place where one employs nothing but aristocrats for the lousiest kinds of jobs.' 'They're all aristocrats, that's true,' said Wyatt, 'because they know that there's no such thing as a lousy job'only lousy men who don't care to do it.' 

> What's wealth but the means of expanding one's life? There's two ways one can do it: either by producing more or by producing it faster. And that's what I'm doing: I'm manufacturing time.' 

> 'I'm producing everything I need, I'm working to improve my methods, and every hour I save is an hour added to my life. It used to take me five hours to fill that tank. It now takes three. The two I saved are mine'as pricelessly mine as if I moved my grave two further hours away for every five I've got. It's two hours released from one task, to be invested in another'two more hours in which to work, to grow, to move forward. That's the savings account I'm hoarding. Is there any sort of safety vault that could protect this account in the outside world?' 

> Here, we trade achievements, not failures'values, not needs. We're free of one another, yet we all grow together. Wealth, Dagny? What greater wealth is there than to own your life and to spend it on growing? Every living thing must grow. It can't stand still. It must grow or perish. 

> I SWEAR BY MY LIFE AND MY LOVE OF IT THAT I WILL NEVER LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER MAN, NOR ASK ANOTHER MAN TO LIVE FOR MINE. 

> Dagny, every form of happiness is one, every desire is driven by the same motor'by our love for a single value, for the highest potentiality of our own existence'and every achievement is an expression of it. Look around you. Do you see how much is open to us here, on an unobstructed earth? 

> 'Every man builds his world in his own image,' he said. 'He has the power to choose, but no power to escape the necessity of choice. If he abdicates his power, he abdicates the status of man, and the grinding chaos of the irrational is what he achieves as his sphere of existence'by his own choice. 

> 'People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one's master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person's view requires to be faked. 

> You have the privilege of strength, but I'I have the right of weakness! That's a moral absolute! Don't you know it! Don't you? Don't you?' 

> 'I'm asking you to give me a job!' 'Why should I?' 'Because I need it!' Rearden pointed to the red spurts of flame shooting from the black shape of a furnace, shooting safely into space four hundred feet of steel-clay-and-steam-embodied thought above them. 'I needed that furnace, Philip. It wasn't my need that gave it to me.' 

> 'Yes, brother! Now why should you be shocked?' She could not resist it. 'Man is only muscles, isn't he? We're going back'back to where there were no interlocking systems, no semaphores, no electricity'back to the time when train signals were not steel and wire, but men holding lanterns. Physical men, serving as lampposts. You've advocated it long enough'you got what you wanted. Oh, you thought that your tools would determine your ideas? But it happens to be the other way around'and now you're going to see the kind of tools your ideas have determined!' 

> The pain in Philip's face was real. A year ago, Rearden would have felt pity. Now, he knew that they had held him through nothing but his reluctance to hurt them, his fear of their pain. He was not afraid of it any longer. 

> The feel of the steering wheel under his hands and of the smooth highway streaming past, as he sped to New York, had an oddly bracing quality. It was a sense of extreme precision and of relaxation, together, a sense of action without strain, which seemed inexplicably youthful'until he realized that this was the way he had acted and had expected always to act, in his youth'and what he now felt was like the simple, astonished question: Why should one ever have to act in any other manner? 

> He thought of all the living species that train their young in the art of survival, the cats who teach their kittens to hunt, the birds who spend such strident effort on teaching their fledglings to fly'yet man, whose tool of survival is the mind, does not merely fail to teach a child to think, but devotes the child's education to the purpose of destroying his brain, of convincing him that thought is futile and evil, before he has started to think. 

> Your pleasure, you have been taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil, and any moral code must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further your life, but to drain it. 

> 'For twelve years, you have been asking: Who is John Galt? This is John Galt speaking. I am the man who loves his life. I am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values. I am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing'you who dread knowledge'I am the man who will now tell you.' 

> You have cried that man's sins are destroying the world and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster. In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy. You have sacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith. You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to self-denial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty. 

> That world is not the product of your sins, it is the product and the image of your virtues. 

> 'We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but have only now understood it. We have no demands to present to you, no terms to bargain about, no compromise to reach. You have nothing to offer us. We do not need you. 

> You damned man, you damned existence, you damned this earth, but never dared to question your code. 

> 'For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighbors'between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your life belongs to you and that the good is to live it. 

> 'Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch'or build a cyclotron'without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think. 

> 'But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call 'human nature,' the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made by instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival'so that for you, who are a human being, the question 'to be or not to be' is the question 'to think or not to think.' 'A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior. He needs a code of values to guide his actions. 'Value' is that which one acts to gain and keep, 'virtue' is the action by which one gains and keeps it. 'Value' presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? 'Value' presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an alternative. Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible. 

> 'There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence'and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not; it depends on a specific course of action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be good or evil. 

> 'An animal is equipped for sustaining its life; its senses provide it with an automatic code of action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil. It has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it. In conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate, it dies. But so long as it lives, it acts on its knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignore its own good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer. 

> Man has the power to act as his own destroyer'and that is the way he has acted through most of his history. 

> 'Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice'and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man'by choice; he has to hold his life as a value'by choice; he has to learn to sustain it'by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues'by choice. 

> The purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live. 

> 'If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness. 

> You cannot have your cake and eat it, too. 

> 'Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is his only means to gain it. Reason is the faculty that perceives, identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses. The task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason; his senses tell him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by his mind. 

> if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking. 

> 'My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists'and in a single choice: to live. 

> honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice for the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness of others. 

> When I disagree with a rational man, I let reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am wrong, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit. 

> 'Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evil that may not, the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction or forgive. So long as men desire to live together, no man may initiate'do you hear me? no man may start'the use of physical force against others. 

> morality ends where a gun begins. 

> 'If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to a worthless stranger, it is. 

> 'This much is true: the most selfish of all things is the independent mind that recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth. You are asked to sacrifice your intellectual integrity, your logic, your reason, your standard of truth'in favor of becoming a prostitute whose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number. 

> 'The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil, provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for them to accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it, unable to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it, provided they do not obtain it by right. 

> 'Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by opposite rules: those who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing, the chosen and the damned, the riders and the carriers, the eaters and the eaten. What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you to the moral elite? The passkey is lack of value. 

> Matter has no value except as a means for the satisfaction of human desires. Matter is only a tool of human values. To what service are you asked to give the material tools your virtue has produced? To the service of that which you regard as evil: to a principle you do not share, to a person you do not respect, to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own'else your gift is not a sacrifice. 

> If you don't like controls'repeal them. If you want higher profits and lower wages'decree them. If you want special privileges for the big tycoons'grant them. If you don't like labor unions'dissolve them. If you want a free economy'order people to be free! 

> I don't pay for the removal of threats. I don't buy my life from anyone.' 

> 'If you had a broken leg, you'd pay a doctor to set it.' 'Not if he was the one who broke it.' 

> 'How will your gun make me do that, Mr. Thompson?' 

> When you force a man to act against his own choice and judgment, it's his thinking that you want him to suspend. 

> Patience, faith and unity'that's the recipe for progress! 

### Entrevista de Ayn Rand à Playboy

> Se o homem toma suas emoções como causa e sua mente como efeito passivo, se ele é guiado por suas emoções e sua mente serve apenas para racionalizá-las ou justificá-las, então ele está agindo de maneira imoral, condenando a si próprio à miséria, ao fracasso, à derrota, e não alcançará nada além de destruição - sua e dos outros. 

> Eu enfaticamente defendo uma visão de mundo preto-e-branca. Definamos esse termo. O que se quer dizer pela expressão "preto-e-branco"? Quer dizer bom e mau. Antes de identificar algo como "cinza", como "meio do caminho", é necessário saber o que é preto e o que é branco, porque o cinza é apenas uma mistura dos dois. E quando você estabeleceu que uma alternativa é boa e que a outra é ruim, não há justificativa para a escolha da mistura. Não há jamais qualquer justificativa para a escolha de parte daquilo que se sabe ser mau. 

> Acredito que o objetivismo seja sua própria proteção contra pessoas que possam tentar usá-lo como dogma. Uma vez que o objetivismo requer o uso da própria mente, aqueles que tentam pegar princípios gerais e aplicá-los indiscriminadamente aos concretos de sua existência veem que isso não pode ser feito. São compelidos a rejeitar o objetivismo ou a aplicá-lo apropriadamente. 

> O homem não sobrevive automaticamente. Ele deve viver como um ser racional e não aceitar menos que isso. Ele não pode sobreviver como um bárbaro. Mesmo o mais simples dos valores, como a comida, deve ser criado pelo homem, deve ser plantado, deve ser produzido. O mesmo é verdadeiro em relação a suas conquistas mais importantes e interessantes. 

> Não há ninguém que eu admire entre os escritores ditos sérios. Prefiro a literatura popular atual, que é a remanescência do romantismo. Dela, meu escritor preferido é Mickey Spillane. 

> Deixe-me responder dessa maneira: quando eu cheguei aqui, saindo da Rússia soviética, eu me interessava em política por somente uma razão - para chegarmos num dia em que eu não teria que ter interesse em política. 

> Quem quer que tenha ideias novas e valiosas a oferecer se coloca fora do status quo intelectual. Mas o status quo não é uma corrente, nem muito menos uma "corrente principal". É um lamaçal estagnado. São os inovadores que carregam a humanidade à frente. 

> Se você me perguntar "O que é grandeza?", eu responderei: é a capacidade de viver de acordo com os três valores fundamentais de John Galt: razão, propósito, auto-estima. Source: http://127.0.0.1:4001/2015/12/07/draft-daytoday-112829-leituras-entrevista-de-ayn-rand-a-playboy/ 

### livro: Barack Obama Vs Ayn Rand (Chanda Chisala)

> You are suggesting that you (as president) can fight theft by taking my property without my willing consent. So, instead of a thief coming to steal my money at night, you simply force me to give him more money during the day (through the minimum wage law) so that he may not become a thief himself? 

> The president is simply replacing theft by night with theft by day. 

> Government must fight criminals, not pacify them, not give them excuses, not bribe them. They should fight the initiators of force with defensive or protective force and put them behind bars. It is not their job to social engineer us in order to reduce crime. 

### Críticas

#### Compaixão

##### paper: A Compaixão Como Uma Ética do Reconhecimento em Schopenhauer (Ana Paula de Araújo Lima)

> A concatenação dessas noções epistêmicas e metafísicas elencadas acima nos habilitará depreender um tipo de ação trabalhada na ética de Schopenhauer: as ações interessadas ou antimorais. Nesse tipo de ação, o agente, mesmo não promovendo nenhum mal a outrem, não reconhece o outro como um ser em si mesmo, apropriando-se de uma expressão kantiana, mas apenas como um meio para atingir o seu interesse particular.

> Torna-se-lhe claro e certo que não conhece sol algum e terra alguma, mas sempre apenas um olho que vê um sol, uma mão que toca a terra.

> O mundo que nos cerca existe somente como representação pelo fato de o sujeito ser o sustentáculo do mundo, posto que a realidade inteira existe 31 em uma relação indissociável com o sujeito: 'Tudo o que pertence e pode pertencer ao mundo está inevitavelmente investido desse estar-condicionado pelo sujeito, existindo apenas para este. O mundo é representação' (SCHOPENHAUER, 2005, p. 44).

> A Vontade, essa força cega, una e desprovida de finalidade que permeia toda a natureza, é o aspecto metafísico que marca ontologicamente todos os seres existentes na natureza. O homem, considerado o grau mais bem elaborado do substrato do mundo, pelo fato de ser provido de racionalidade e de conseguir abstrair a realidade para além da imediatez das representações intuitivas, também é considerado um 'animal metafísico'.

> a vontade é o conhecimento a priori do corpo, e o corpo é o conhecimento a posteriori da vontade. (SCHOPENHAUER, 2005, p, 157, grifos do autor)

> Pelo fato de os atos da vontade (vontade pensada aqui como mola impulsora do querer interior) não diferirem dos atos do próprio corpo é que Schopenhauer defende a tese que o conhecimento que o indivíduo possui de si, ou seja, da sua própria existência enquanto um organismo vivo é imediato. Essa compreensão, que é anterior ao próprio principio de razão suficiente, só o sujeito é capaz de ter. Isso explica o porquê de as ações humanas, quase que em sua maioria, não reconhecerem o outro no momento de agir, pois este último será apenas apreendido como 'objeto mediato do conhecimento' nunca como manifestação da coisa em si .

> Nas palavras de Schopenhauer: Mas se finalmente aprendemos, então alcançamos o que no mundo se chama caráter, o CARÁTER ADQUIRIDO. Este nada mais é senão o conhecimento mais acabado possível da própria individualidade.

> Mesmo que a ação de um determinado agente não promova nenhum mal a outrem, ou seja, que o seu ato não 'cause' nenhum dano ao organismo de outro ser, que sente dor e luta diariamente pela sobrevivência, para Schopenhauer, se a ação for interessada, ela será desprovida de 'propriedades morais'. A base dessas ações é o egoísmo.

> Em contrapartida, as ações morais (seja por meio da justiça ou da caridade) possuem apenas a compaixão como fundamento. Isso acontece porque o interesse particular é suspenso momentaneamente para promover o bem-estar alheio.

> [...] faz, no entanto, de si mesmo o centro do universo antepondo a própria existência e o bem-estar a tudo o mais, sim, do ponto de vista natural está preparado a sacrificar qualquer coisa, até mesmo a aniquilar o mundo, simplesmente para conservar mais um pouco o próprio si-mesmo, esta gota no meio do oceano. Eis aí a mentalidade do EGOÍSMO, o qual é essencial a cada coisa na natureza. (SCHOPENHAUER, 2005, pp. 426-427, grifo do autor)

> Para que um ato seja compassivo é necessário que o indivíduo desprenda-se das representações ilusórias e intua a própria essência 65 íntima do mundo da qual participam todas as manifestações da Vontade, sejam seres humanos ou mesmo animais.

> Schopenhauer esclarece que a compaixão não requer nenhum saber abstrato, pois não pode ser comunicada, tendo em vista que deve brotar em cada um de maneira natural.

> Segundo Schopenhauer, alguns indivíduos podem renascer de diversas maneiras e isso irá depender do grau de maldade que porventura eles tenham ocasionado aos outros em vida. Para Schopenhauer, essas pessoas poderão vir como seres inferiores, doentes, etc.

> Para Schopenhauer, a virtude da caridade visa, em primeiro lugar, o bem-estar alheio de maneira imediata e direta, destituída de qualquer interesse egoísta, pois quem carrega no peito esse sentimento de ser caritativo é despertado pelo regozijo interior, que Schopenhauer chamou de 'consciência boa, pacificada e aprovadora'

> Isso mostra que o olhar do caridoso em relação a si mesmo é digno de apreço e reverência.

> Schopenhauer explica que a compaixão tem sua comprovação na experiência cotidiana. O filósofo afirma que 'A ausência de toda motivação egoísta é, portanto, o critério de uma ação dotada de valor moral'

> [...] Portanto, a autêntica bondade de disposição, a virtude desinteressada e a pura nobreza não se originam do conhecimento abstrato, embora sem dúvida se originem do conhecimento, a saber, de um conhecimento imediato e intuitivo que não pode ser adquirido ou eliminado por raciocínios.

> Isso mostra que, sendo a compaixão um sentimento imediato, os indivíduos ao participarem das dores e sofrimentos de outros não podem esperar nenhuma restituição ou recompensa futura. A compaixão é destituída de qualquer interesse.

> 'só se eu partilhar de seu sofrimento, sentindo-o de certa forma como meu, pode seu bem-estar e o alívio de sua aflição virem a me motivar'(JANAWAY, 2003, p.121).

> Para Schopenhauer, a moral do cristianismo é um exemplo claro da falta de compaixão e os efeitos da religião em relação à moralidade são mínimos.

> Na obra Sobre o fundamento da moral (2001), o autor comenta 'a compaixão para com os animais liga-se tão estritamente com a bondade de caráter que se pode afirmar confiantemente que quem é cruel com os animais não pode ser uma boa pessoa' (SCHOPENHAUER, 2001, p. 179).

> Além disso, deve-se ressaltar que aqui há o reconhecimento para com o outro ser que sofre, independentemente de o mesmo ser provido de racionalidade ou não.

> É importante ressaltar que a felicidade só pode ser medida pela ausência de dor, pois só ela tem um caráter negativo, enquanto que a dor tem um caráter positivo. Cf. MÁRQUEZ. P. M. J .

> Para Schopenhauer, '[...] o sofrimento é essencial e a satisfação verdadeira é impossível' (SCHOPENHAUER, 2005, pp. 410-411).

> Schopenhauer relata: O consolo mais eficaz em toda infelicidade, em todo sofrimento, é observar os outros, que são ainda mais infelizes do que nós: e isto é possível a cada um.

> Em Hegel, o reconhecimento é trabalhado via dialética e sua teoria segue um percurso histórico no qual se agregam momentos necessários para se chegar a uma teoria social do Estado. Já Schopenhauer não trabalha a categoria reconhecimento de maneira explícita em suas obras, visto que ele 103 não percorre nenhum caminho dialético e nem aborda nenhuma teoria política e social no âmbito do Estado como a teoria hegeliana. Pelo contrário, Schopenhauer foi um critico severo de Hegel.

> A participação direta no sofrimento de alguém de maneira instintiva é a única fonte verdadeiramente dotada de valor moral. A compaixão desperta em 105 nós um contentamento íntimo, o qual Schopenhauer chama de 'consciência boa, pacificada e aprovadora' (SCHOPENHAUER, 2001, p. 160). Em decorrência dessa participação direta, surge também no observador certa aprovação, respeito e admiração por si mesmo e esse olhar voltado para si faz com que, em certa medida, ele se torne também um sujeito digno de admiração.

> Assim, o homem de bom caráter está sempre em prontidão para prestar ajuda a seus semelhantes. O homem de má índole, pelo contrário, prioriza a sua individualidade e isso é o que o torna diferente do bom caráter. Portanto, o reconhecimento está presente mesmo que implicitamente na teoria moral de Schopenhauer.

> Para Schopenhauer, o homem que consegue olhar sua própria essência nos demais seres está livre da sua individualidade e consequentemente livre do véu da ilusão.

> tendo em vista que, nessa obra, o autor segue uma via dialética para explicar a relação entre dominante e dominado.

> Percebemos que o reconhecimento em Hegel é somente entre consciências e não se dá em relação aos animais por ser Hegel um filósofo que vê na racionalidade toda a veracidade do real, ou seja, do mundo.

> Hegel, ao tratar sobre o tema do reconhecimento, não aborda a 114 ajuda ativa do senhor em relação ao escravo, ou seja, nessa metáfora, o senhor não reconhece nenhum tipo de sofrimento no escravo, que é visto como uma coisidade e não como outro indivíduo que sofre.

> Por fim, procuramos verificar a possibilidade de se pensar uma ética do reconhecimento aos moldes schopenhauerianos e tentamos descrever alguns casos que Schopenhauer expôs ao longo de suas obras O mundo como vontade e como representação e Sobre o fundamento da moral, em especial, o caso dos jovens Caio e Tito, bem como o caso do caçador Harris. Se tomarmos esses casos como exemplo, então podemos aferir que, por meio do sofrimento, a compaixão pode ser vislumbrada como uma ética do reconhecimento em Schopenhauer.
