# Intermittent Fasting

## Intermittent versus daily calorie restriction: which diet regimen is more effective for weight loss? - Varady - 2011 - Obesity Reviews - Wiley Online Library (wiley.com)

These findings suggest that these diets are equally as effective in decreasing body weight and fat mass, although intermittent CR may be more effective for the retention of lean mass. 

When an individual loses weight by dietary restriction alone, approximately 75% of weight is lost as fat mass, and 25% of weight is lost as fat free mass 

It was also noted that in the majority of these studies, weight loss by daily CR resulted from a 75¿80% decrease in fat mass, and a 20¿25% decrease in fat free mass 

Thus, although the data are limited, consuming a background diet that is high in protein during daily CR may have no effect on retention of lean mass. 

so no comparisons between diets could be made for longer intervention periods. 

From the studies reviewed here, it would appear as though a lower proportion of lean mass is lost in response to intermittent CR (90% weight lost as fat, 10% weight loss as fat free mass) when compared to daily CR (75% weight lost as fat, 25% weight loss as fat free mass) 

For each study, it was observed that as per cent weight loss increased, per cent visceral mass fat loss (assessed by MRI in most trials) was also augmented in a roughly linear fashion. For instance, in the studies that achieved 6¿8% weight loss, visceral fat mass was reduced by 6¿13% . 

In the trial that achieved greater weight loss (13% from baseline), more pronounced decreases in visceral fat mass were noted (26% from baseline) .

## The effect on health of alternate day calorie restriction: Eating less and more than needed on alternate days prolongs life (this authorAffiliationsDepartment of Surgery)

> Restricting caloric intake to 6070% of normal adult weight maintenance requirement prolongs lifespan 3050% and confers near perfect health across a broad range of species. Every other day feeding produces similar effects in rodents, and profound beneficial physiologic changes have been demonstrated in the absence of weight loss in ob/ob mice. Since May 2003 we have experimented with alternate day calorie restriction, one day consuming 2050% of estimated daily caloric requirement and the next day ad lib eating, and have observed health benefits starting in as little as two weeks, in insulin resistance, asthma, seasonal allergies, infectious diseases of viral, bacterial and fungal origin (viral URI, recurrent bacterial tonsillitis, chronic sinusitis, periodontal disease), autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis), osteoarthritis, symptoms due to CNS inflammatory lesions (Tourettes, Menieres) cardiac arrhythmias (PVCs, atrial fibrillation), menopause related hot flashes. We hypothesize that other many conditions would be delayed, prevented or improved, including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, multiple sclerosis, brain injury due to thrombotic stroke atherosclerosis, NIDDM, congestive heart failure.

> Our hypothesis is supported by an article from 1957 in the Spanish medical literature which due to a translation error has been construed by several authors to be the only existing example of calorie restriction with good nutrition. We contend for reasons cited that there was no reduction in calories overall, but that the subjects were eating, on alternate days, either 900 calories or 2300 calories, averaging 1600, and that body weight was maintained. Thus they consumed either 56% or 144% of daily caloric requirement. The subjects were in a residence for old people, and all were in perfect health and over 65. Over three years, there were 6 deaths among 60 study subjects and 13 deaths among 60 ad lib-fed controls, non-significant difference. Study subjects were in hospital 123 days, controls 219, highly significant difference. We believe widespread use of this pattern of eating could impact influenza epidemics and other communicable diseases by improving resistance to infection. In addition to the health effects, this pattern of eating has proven to be a good method of weight control, and we are continuing to study the process in conjunction with the NIH.

## 11 Myths About Fasting and Meal Frequency (Kris Gunnars)

Although many observational studies have found statistical links between breakfast skipping and overweight/obesity, this may be explained by the fact that the stereotypical breakfast skipper is less health-conscious overall. 

Interestingly, this matter was recently settled in a randomized controlled trial, which is the gold standard of science. This study was published in 2014 and compared eating breakfast vs skipping breakfast in 283 overweight and obese adults ( 1 ). After a 16-week study period, there was no difference in weight between groups. 

Bottom Line: There is no consistent evidence that eating more often reduces overall hunger or calorie intake. Some studies even show that smaller, more frequent meals increase hunger. 

If eating more frequently has no effect on the energy balance equation, then it shouldn¿t have any effect on weight loss. In fact, this is supported by science. Most studies on this do show that meal frequency has no effect on weight loss ( 11 , 12 ). 

Some people believe that if we don¿t eat carbs every few hours, that our brains will stop functioning. This is based on the belief that the brain can only use glucose (blood sugar) for fuel. 

However, what is often left out of the discussion is that the body can easily produce the glucose it needs via a process called gluconeogenesis ( 14 ). 

Even during long-term fasting, starvation or a very low-carbohydrate diet , the body can produce ketone bodies from dietary fats ( 15 ). Ketone bodies can provide energy for part of the brain, reducing its glucose requirement significantly. 

There are also some observational studies showing that people who eat more often have a much higher risk of colorectal cancer ( 23 , 24 ). 

It is actually true that long-term weight loss can reduce the amount of calories you burn. This is the true ¿ starvation mode ¿ (the technical term is adaptive thermogenesis) ( 25 ). 

This is a real effect, and can amount to hundreds of fewer calories burned per day. 

However, this happens with weight loss no matter what method you use. There is no evidence that this happens more with intermittent fasting than other weight loss strategies. 

In fact, the evidence actually shows that short-term fasts increase metabolic rate. This is due to a drastic increase in blood levels of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which tells the fat cells to break down body fat and stimulates metabolism ( 26 , 27 ). 

One study showed that fasting every other day for 22 days did not lead to a decrease in metabolic rate, but the participants lost 4% of their fat mass, which is impressive for a period as short as 3 weeks ( 30 ). 

There are some who claim that we can only digest 30 grams of protein per meal, and that we should eat every 2-3 hours to maximize muscle gain. However, this is not supported by science. Studies do not show a difference in muscle mass if you eat your protein in more frequent doses ( 31 , 32 , 33 ). 

The most important factor for most people is the total amount of protein consumed, not how many meals it is spread over. 

In one review study, intermittent calorie restriction caused a similar amount of weight loss as continuous calorie restriction, but much less reduction in muscle mass ( 34 ). There was also a study that had participants eat the same amount of calories as they were used to, except in one huge meal in the evening ( 31 ). These people lost body fat and actually had a modest increase (almost statistically significant) in their muscle mass, along with a bunch of other beneficial effects on health markers. 

It may also be good for brain health by boosting levels of a brain hormone called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This may be protective against depression and various other brain problems ( 42 , 43 , 44 ). 

However, this compensation isn¿t complete. One study showed that people who fasted for a whole day only ended up eating about 500 extra calories the next day ( 45 ). So they expended about 2400 calories during the fasting day, then ¿overate¿ by 500 calories the day after. The total reduction in calorie intake was then 1900 calories, which is a very large deficit for only 2 days.

## Intermittent Fasting 101 - The Ultimate Beginner's Guide (Kris Gunnars)

For example, your body changes hormone levels to make stored body fat more accessible. 

Human Growth Hormone (HGH): The levels of growth hormone skyrocket, increasing as much as 5-fold. This has benefits for fat loss and muscle gain, to name a few ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). Insulin: Insulin sensitivity improves and levels of insulin drop dramatically. Lower insulin levels make stored body fat more accessible ( 8 ). Cellular repair: When fasted, your cells initiate cellular repair processes. This includes autophagy , where cells digest and remove old and dysfunctional proteins that build up inside cells ( 9 , 10 ) Gene expression: There are changes in the function of genes related to longevity and protection against disease ( 11 , 12 ). 

Studies show that intermittent fasting can be a very powerful weight loss tool. In a review study from 2014, it was shown to cause weight loss of 3-8% over periods of 3-24 weeks ( 1 ). 

Weight Loss: As mentioned above, intermittent fasting can help you lose weight and belly fat, without having to consciously restrict calories ( 1 , 13 ). Insulin resistance: Intermittent fasting can reduce insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar by 3-6% and fasting insulin levels by 20-31% ( 1 ). This should protect against type 2 diabetes. Inflammation: Some studies show reductions in markers of inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases ( 17 , 18 , 19 ). Heart Health: Intermittent fasting may reduce LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar and insulin resistance. These are all risk factors for heart disease ( 1 , 20 , 21 ). Cancer: Animal studies suggest that intermittent fasting may help prevent cancer ( 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ). Brain Health: Intermittent fasting increases a brain hormone called BDNF , and may aid the growth of new nerve cells ( 26 , 27 , 28 ). It may also protect against Alzheimer¿s disease ( 29 ). Anti-aging: Intermittent fasting can extend lifespan in rats. Studies showed that fasted rats live as much as 36-83% longer ( 30 , 31 ). 

Yes, fasted workouts are fine. Some people recommend taking branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) before a fasted workout.

## The Beginner's Guide to Intermittent Fasting (jamesclear.com)

When you are in the fed state, it¿s very hard for your body to burn fat because your insulin levels are high. 

The post¿absorptive state lasts until 8 to 12 hours after your last meal, which is when you enter the fasted state. 

It is much easier for you body to burn fat in the fasted state because your insulin levels are low. 

When you¿re in the fasted state your body can burn fat that has been inaccessible during the fed state.

## Fasting: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Applications (Valter D. Longo1 and  Mark P. Mattson2)

__Introduction__. Fasting has been practiced for millennia, but only recently studies have shed light on its role in adaptive cellular responses that reduce oxidative damage and inflammation, optimize energy metabolism and bolster cellular protection. In lower eukaryotes, chronic fasting extends longevity in part by reprogramming metabolic and stress resistance pathways. In rodents intermittent or periodic fasting protects against diabetes, cancers, heart disease and neurodegeneration, while in humans it helps reduce obesity, hypertension, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, fasting has the potential to delay aging and help prevent and treat diseases while minimizing the side effects caused by chronic dietary interventions. 

__Alternate metabolic program.__ The effect of rich medium but not acetate in reducing longevity raises the possibility that a ketone body-like carbon source such as acetate may be part of an "alternate metabolic program" that evolved billions of years ago in microorganisms and that now allows mammals to survive during periods of food deprivation by obtaining much of the energy by catabolizing fatty acids and ketone bodies including acetoacetate and hydroxybutyrate. 

__Alternate energy sources in fasting.__ In most mammals, the liver serves as the main reservoir of glucose, which is stored in the form of glycogen. In humans, depending upon their level of physical activity, 12 to 24 hours of fasting typically results in a 20% or greater decrease in serum glucose (blood sugar) and depletion of the hepatic glycogen, accompanied by a switch to a metabolic mode in which non-hepatic glucose, fat-derived ketone bodies and free fatty acids (circulating in the plasma) are used as energy sources.

__Gluconeogenesis for the brain.__ Whereas most tissues can utilize fatty acids for energy, during prolonged periods of fasting, the brain relies on the ketone bodies hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in addition to glucose for energy consumption. Ketone bodies are produced in hepatocytes from the acetyl-CoA generated from oxidation of fatty acids released into the bloodstream by adipocytes, and also by the conversion of ketogenic amino acids. After hepatic glycogen depletion, ketone bodies, fat-derived glycerol, and amino acids account for the gluconeogenesis-dependent generation of approximately 80 grams/day of glucose, which is mostly utilized by the brain. 

In humans, during prolonged fasting, the plasma levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate are about 5 times those of free fatty acids and acetoacetic acid 

In mammals, severe CR/food deprivation results in a decrease in the size of most organs except the brain, and the testicles in male mice 

The magnitude of the effects of alternate day fasting on longevity in rodents depends upon the species and age at regimen initiation, and can range from a negative effect to as much as an 80% lifespan extension 

Here we review the fascinating and potent effects of different forms of fasting including intermittent fasting (IF, including alternate day fasting, or twice weekly fasting, for example) and periodic fasting (PF) lasting several days or longer every 2 or more weeks. We focus on fasting and minimize the discussion of CR, a topic reviewed elsewhere 

Several major physiological responses to fasting are similar to those caused by regular aerobic exercise including increased insulin sensitivity and cellular stress resistance, reduced resting blood pressure and heart rate, and increased heart rate variability as a result of increased parasympathetic tone 

Emerging findings suggest that exercise and IF retard aging and some age-related diseases by shared mechanisms involving improved cellular stress adaptation 

However, in two different mouse genetic backgrounds, IF did not extend mean lifespan and even reduced lifespan when initiated at 10 months. When initiated at 1.5 months, IF either increased longevity or had no effect 

For example, one possibility is that fasting may be consistently protective in young and middle aged laboratory rodents that are either gaining or maintaining a body weight, but may be detrimental in older animals that, similarly to humans, begin to lose weight prior to their death. 

The age-dependent weight loss may make this sensitivity to long periods of fasting worse. 

Although these studies underline the need for an in depth understanding of its mechanisms of action, fasting is expected to have cancer preventive effects as indicated by the studies above and by the findings that multiple cycles of periodic fasting can be as effective as toxic chemotherapy in the treatment of some cancers in mice 

PF also causes a major sensitization of various cancer cells to chemo-treatment, since it fosters an extreme environment in combination with the stress conditions caused by chemotherapy. 

In mouse models of metastatic tumors, combinations of fasting and chemotherapy that cause DSR and DSS, result in 20 to 60% cancer-free survival compared to the same levels of chemotherapy or fasting alone, which are not sufficient to cause any cancer-free survival 

Several interrelated cellular mechanisms contribute to the beneficial effects of IF on the nervous system including reduced accumulation of oxidatively damaged molecules, improved cellular bioenergetics, enhanced neurotrophic factor signaling, and reduced inflammation. The latter neuroprotective mechanisms are supported by studies showing that IF diets boost levels of antioxidant defenses, neurotrophic factors (BDNF and FGF2) and protein chaperones (HSP-70 and GRP-78), and reduce levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF", IL-1" and IL-6). IF may also promote restoration of damaged nerve cell circuits by stimulating synapse formation and the production of new neurons from neural stem cells (neurogenesis). Interestingly, while beneficial in models of most neurodegenerative conditions, there is evidence that fasting can hasten neurodegeneration in some models of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, perhaps because the motor neurons affected in those models are unable to respond adaptively to the moderate stress imposed by fasting 

Metabolic syndrome (MS), defined as abdominal adiposity, combined with insulin resistance, elevated triglycerides and/or hypertension, greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke and AD. Rats and mice maintained under the usual ad libitum feeding condition develop an MS-like phenotype as they age. MS can also be induced in younger animals by feeding them a diet high in fat and simple sugars. IF can prevent and reverse all aspects of the MS in rodents: abdominal fat, inflammation and blood pressure are reduced, insulin sensitivity is increased, and the functional capacities of the nervous, neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems are improved (; ). Hyperglycemia is ameliorated by IF in rodent models of diabetes and the heart is protected against ischemic injury in myocardial infarction models. A protective effect of fasting against ischemic renal and liver injury occurs rapidly, with 1 " 3 days of fasting improving functional outcome and reducing tissue injury and mortality. Six days on a diet missing just a single essential amino acid such as tryptophan can also elicit changes in metabolism and stress resistance, similar to those caused by fasting, which are dependent on the amino acid sensing kinase Gcn2. 

IF can be achieved in with a minimal decrease in overall calorie intake if the refeeding period in which subjects overeat is considered. Thus, fasting cycles provide a much more feasible strategy to achieve the beneficial effects of CR, and possibly stronger effects, without the burden of chronic underfeeding and some of the potentially adverse effects associated with weight loss or very low BMIs. 

Fasting has the potential for applications in both cancer prevention and treatment. Although no human data are available on the effect of IF or PF in cancer prevention, their effect on reducing IGF-1, insulin and glucose levels, and increasing IGFBP1 and ketone body levels could generate a protective environment that reduces DNA damage and carcinogenesis, while at the same time creating hostile conditions for tumor and pre-cancerous cells 

In fact, elevated circulating IGF-1 is associated with increased risk of developing certain cancers (; ) and individuals with severe IGF-1deficiency caused by growth hormone receptor deficiency, rarely develop cancer 

Furthermore, once their DNA became damaged, cells were more likely to undergo programmed cell death. Thus, fasting may protect from cancer by reducing cellular and DNA damage but also by enhancing the death of pre-cancerous cells. 

Overweight subjects maintained for 6 months on a twice weekly IF diet in which they consumed only 500"600 calories on the fasting days, lost abdominal fat, displayed improved insulin sensitivity and reduced blood pressure 

Results of initial trials of IF (fasting 2 days per week or every other day) in human subjects suggest that there is a critical transition period of 3 " 6 weeks during which time the brain and body adapt to the new eating pattern and mood is enhanced
