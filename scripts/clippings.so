For example, on a heavily loaded file server, the System process will likely consume considerable CPU time. But knowing that when the System process is running, “some system thread” is running isn’t enough to determine which device driver or OS component is running.")
call matchadd("search", "So if threads in the System process are running, first determine which ones are running (for example, with the Performance Monitor or Process Explorer tools). Once you find the thread (or threads) that is running, look up in which driver the system thread began execution. This at least tells you which driver likely created the thread. For example, in Process Explorer, right-click the System process and select Properties. Then, in the Threads tab, click the CPU column header to view the most active thread at the top. Select this thread and click the Module button to see the file from which the code on the top of stack is running. Because the System process is protected in recent versions of Windows, Process Explorer is unable to show a call stack.")

This access token is then used by Winlogon to create the initial process(es) in the user’s session.")
