call matchadd("search", "With Windows 8 and later, the console architecture changed yet again. The Conhost.exe process remains, but is now spawned from the console-based process (rather than from Csrss.exe, as in Windows 7) by the console driver (\Windows\System32\Drivers\ConDrv.sys). The process in question communicates with Conhost.exe using the console driver (ConDrv.sys), by sending read, write, I/O control and other I/O request types. Conhost.exe is designated as a server and the process using the console is the client. This change obviates the need for Csrss.exe to receive keyboard input (as part of the raw input thread), send it through Win32k.sys to Conhost.exe, and then use ALPC to send it to Cmd.exe. Instead, the command-line application can directly receive input from the console driver through read/write I/Os, avoiding needless context switching.")

As the name suggests, this refers to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) component, and these drivers make up the Pico provider interface for it. Because the Pico provider receives almost all possible transitions to and from user and kernel mode (be they system calls or exceptions, for example), as long as the Pico process (or processes) running underneath it has an address space that it can recognize, and has code that can natively execute within it, the “true” kernel below doesn’t really matter as long as these transitions are handled in a fully transparent way.")
