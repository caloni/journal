call matchadd("search", "Which one is faster?The first one does one for loop and the other one does two for loops. But then, the first solution has two lines of code per for loop rather than one. If you're going to count the number of instructions, then you'd have to go to the assembly level and take into account that multiplication requires more instructions than addition, how the compiler would optimize something, and all sorts of other details. This would be horrendously complicated, so don't even start going down this road. Big O allows us to express how the runtime scales. We just need to accept that it doesn't mean that O(N) is always better than O(N2).")
