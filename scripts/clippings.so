call matchadd("search", "IA-32 processors support special memory management constructs called segments, but these are not used in Windows and can be safely ignored in most cases. There are several segment registers in IA-32 processors: CS, DS, FS, ES, and SS. On Windows, any mentioning of any of those can be safely ignored except for FS, which allows access to a small area of thread-local memory. Memory accesses that start with FS: are usually accessing that thread-local area.")

Don't let the DWORD PTR prefix fool you; this instruction is purely an arithmetic operation.")
