call matchadd("search", "As a rule of thumb, increasing degree of roast leads to decreasing acidity and increasing bitterness.")
call matchadd("search", "Although caffeine—which is present in the green bean—has a strong bitter taste, it contributes only some 10–20% to the sensory perceived bitterness in coffee.")
call matchadd("search", "fast roasted beans generate larger gas quantities than slow roasted")
call matchadd("search", "fast roasted beans exhibit much greater bean volume and porosity and lower density than slow roasted")
call matchadd("search", "more soluble matter can be extracted from fast roasted beans. This may be due to greater generation of soluble matter or to better accessibility for the water in high porosity structure or to both.")
call matchadd("search", "Fast roasted beans finish the roasting process with a slightly higher final moisture content.")
call matchadd("search", "Fast roasted beans exhibit also a considerably stronger tendency for oil sweating.")
call matchadd("search", "The same aroma impact compounds are formed regardless of the roasting time. However, the quantities of individual compounds or compound groups depend on the roasting time in various ways.")
call matchadd("search", "Fast roasted coffee usually delivers more acidity in the cup profile and often a stronger “roasty” note. Slow roasted coffees often show higher intensity in sensory attributes such as “balanced,” “fruity,” “nut-like,” and “toasty” notes.")
call matchadd("search", "As a beginner or apprentice, the artisan must become familiar with the impact each adjustment has on the roast, and by extension, the cup quality.")
call matchadd("search", "Before the tasting can begin, an artisan must rely heavily on their senses of sight and smell as the coffee progresses in the roaster.")
call matchadd("search", "The roast plan and intended outcome are commonly referred to as the “profile.” A profile can mean both the course of development for the beans inside the roasting machine and the intended flavor characteristics realized in the cup.")
call matchadd("search", "The sense of sight and smell become increasingly more crucial after first crack as this is when the artisan must decide on, and execute, the correct drop time at the desired temperature.")
call matchadd("search", "Green coffee is primarily composed of carbohydrates, nitrogen (N)-containing compounds (mainly proteins, trigonelline, and caffeine), lipids, organic acids, and water.")
call matchadd("search", "Almost all free sugars are lost upon roasting due to Maillard reaction and caramelization, giving rise to water, carbon dioxide, color, aroma, and taste.")
call matchadd("search", "Flavor consists of two distinct sensory modalities, i.e., the volatile aroma perceived nasally and the nonvolatile taste perceived in the oral cavity.")
call matchadd("search", "The experienced coffee roaster knows that the aroma evolves from sweet, fruity, floral, bread, and nutty character in light roasts, through more complex aroma profiles in medium roast. Darker roast levels are characterized by cocoa, spicy, phenolic, ashy, pungent, and dark roast flavors.")

call matchadd("search", "for Windows Apps (those hosting the Windows Runtime), Suspended normally occurs when the app loses its foreground status by being minimized by the user. Such processes are suspended after 5 seconds so that they don’t consume any CPU or networking resources, thus allowing the new foreground app to get all machine resources. This is especially important for battery-powered devices, such as tablets and phones.")
call matchadd("search", "The third possible value for Status is Not Responding. This can happen if a thread within the process that created the user interface has not checked its message queue for UI-related activity for at least 5 seconds.")
call matchadd("search", "In the case of the Process Explorer tool, the start time of the parent process is taken into account to avoid attaching a child process based on a reused process ID.")

call matchadd("search", "To prove that Windows doesn’t keep track of more than just the parent process ID, follow these steps: 1. Press WinKey+R, type cmd, and press Enter to open a Command Prompt window. 2. Type title Parent to change the title of the window to Parent. 3. Type start cmd to open a second Command Prompt window. 4. Type title Child in the second Command Prompt window. 5. Type mspaint in the second Command Prompt window to start Microsoft Paint. 6. Go back to the second Command Prompt window and type exit. Notice that Paint remains. 7. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. 8. If Task Manager is in “less details” mode, click More Details. 9. Click the Processes tab. 10. Find the Windows Command Processor app and expand its node. You should see the title Parent, as in the following screenshot: 11. Right-click the Windows Command Processor entry and select Go to details. 12. Right-click this cmd.exe process and select End Process Tree. 13. Click End Process Tree in the Task Manager confirmation dialog box. The first Command Prompt window will disappear, but you should still see the Paint window because it was the grandchild of the command prompt process you terminated. Because the intermediate process (the parent of Paint) was terminated, there was no link between the parent and the grandchild.")
