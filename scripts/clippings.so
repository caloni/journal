call matchadd("search", "The aroma of green coffee is described as green, hay- and pea-like ( Gretsch et al., 1999 ), and the taste as sweet, astringent ( Viani and Petracco, 2007 ), which indeed is very different from the product after roasting.")

call matchadd("search", "The complex mixture and balance of the volatile fraction make up for only about 0.1% of the total roasted coffee weight, with single components ranging from parts per trillion (ppt) levels to higher part per million (ppm) levels, making it to one of the beverages with the richest and most complex flavor content ( Hertz-Schünemann et al., 2013 ).")
call matchadd("search", "Meanwhile it is broadly accepted that it is not the number of components that defines the quality, intensity, or characteristic of the overall odor impression of a food stuff. Indeed, for only about 25–30 key odorants a contribution to the overall aroma of coffee has been evidenced ( Blank et al., 1992 ; Grosch, 1998 , 2001a ; Kerler and Poisson, 2011 ).")

In addition, only a limited number of genuine volatile compounds are spread in most of the food matrices and less than 3% of foodborne volatiles constitute the chemical odorant space ( Dunkel et al., 2014 ).")

call matchadd("search", "Basically, the Maillard reaction is an amino-catalyzed sugar degradation leading to aroma, taste, and color (melanoidins). Sucrose, the most abundant free sugar in green coffee beans, needs first to be decomposed into glucose and fructose by heat treatment to undergo Maillard-type reactions.")
call matchadd("search", "The identification and formation pathways of bitterness components in roasted coffee have recently been elucidated. CGA lactones, breakdown products of CGA (CQAs), have been identified as one of the main contributors to bitterness in coffee. In addition hydroxylated phenylindanes have been reported as intense bitter-tasting compounds ( Frank et al., 2007 ).")
call matchadd("search", "Most of the polymeric carbohydrates, lipids, caffeine, and inorganic salts survive the roasting process. Alkaloids such as caffeine are relatively stable and only trigonelline is partially degraded to volatile compounds ( Viani and Horman, 1974")
