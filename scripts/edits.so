call matchadd("search", "As you continue your training, please keep a few things in mind. First, exercise and physical training are meant to make you feel good and improve your quality of life. If you ever find that your quality of health and life are eroding, please stop and reconsider your approach. Fitness habits that compromise your well-being are neither healthy nor productive. Second, listen to your body and trust your instincts. Diet and exercise are far from an exact science; even the leading experts don’t have all of the answers. If you feel that making a change in your approach may be a good idea, then it is worth acting on that instinct. Lastly, know that you’ll learn far more from personal experience than from any book. Resources like this and the others listed in the back of the book (see here ), are great places to get ideas, but the real source of knowledge and understanding is to take massive action. Make your plan and take your first step. Where you go from there is up to you, and I’m sure it’s going to be a fun and rewarding lifelong journey.")
call matchadd("search", "Internal pain is a much more serious issue, often showing up in the joints, ligaments, and tendons. You can usually identify tendon pain in the form of a sharp and burning sensation around a joint, especially when the joint is under a load. Tendon pain often occurs in joints that have little muscular support like the knees, elbows, and wrists. Pain in these areas should always be addressed and never “worked through” or ignored. Doing so only leads to a greater degree of internal damage, often requiring more serious measures to address it in the future.")
call matchadd("search", "The most important thing to remember is that your healthy habits should improve how you feel. They should make you feel happier, more motivated, more energized, and should reduce pain. If you start to experience chronic fatigue, pain, or a general loss of motivation, there’s a good chance something is having a detrimental influence on your mind and body and should be addressed as soon as possible.")
call matchadd("search", "Recovery also includes mental and emotional rest. Meditation, relaxing, and just plain having fun are not luxuries. They are essential elements in your health and should be pursued on a daily basis. Make time to blow off steam and do something that feels good. Sing and dance to your favorite song as you drive home from work. Take a walk along the local nature trail or in the park during your lunch break. Talk to a friend about something other than work.")
call matchadd("search", "In fitness, stress is like medicine. In the right doses, stress stimulates health and progress. However, if you get the dose wrong, stress can poison both body and mind and break your results rather than make them.")
call matchadd("search", "The first important aspect of health and recovery is rest. Your body doesn’t change during your workouts; it changes—grows stronger, more flexible, and more fit—in recovery. Therefore, if you hardly rest, you’ll severely compromise your results.")
call matchadd("search", "Taking time to cool down is like landing an airplane after a long flight. Failing to practice recovery methods is akin to taking your plane up in the sky, and then just letting it drop whenever it runs out of gas. While it is possible to skip your cool down exercises, practicing them ensures that you remain in control, so you’re less likely to crash later on.")
