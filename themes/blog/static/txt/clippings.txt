Vitamin D - The Nutrition Source

Vitamin D is both a nutrient we eat and a hormone our bodies make. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that has long been known to help the body absorb and retain calcium and phosphorus; both are critical for building bone. Also, laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections and reduce inflammation. Many of the body’s organs and tissues have receptors for vitamin D, which suggest important roles beyond bone health, and scientists are actively investigating other possible functions.

Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 (“ergocalciferol” or pre-vitamin D) and vitamin D3 (“cholecalciferol”).

Both are also naturally occurring forms that are produced in the presence of the sun’s ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays, hence its nickname, “the sunshine vitamin,” but D2 is produced in plants and fungi and D3 in animals, including humans.

Although observational studies see a strong connection with lower rates of certain diseases in populations that live in sunnier climates or have higher serum levels of vitamin D, clinical trials that give people vitamin D supplements to affect a particular disease are still inconclusive.

A clinical trial that gave women 70+ years of age a once-yearly dosage of vitamin D at 500,000 IU for five years caused a 15% increased risk of falls and a 26% higher fracture risk than women who received a placebo.

It was speculated that super-saturating the body with a very high dose given infrequently may have actually promoted lower blood levels of the active form of vitamin D that might not have occurred with smaller, more frequent doses.

JoAnn Manson, MD, DrPH, leader of the main VITAL trial and coauthor of the report on fracture, commented: “We conclude that, in the generally healthy U.S. population of midlife and older adults, vitamin D supplementation doesn’t reduce the risk of fractures or falls. This suggests that only small-to-moderate amounts of vitamin D are needed for bone health and fall prevention, achieved by most community-dwelling adults.

Immune and inflammatory cells that play a role in cardiovascular disease conditions like atherosclerosis are regulated by vitamin D. [40] The vitamin also helps to keep arteries flexible and relaxed, which in turn helps to control high blood pressure. [41]

However, taking vitamin D supplements has not been found to reduce cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of 51 clinical trials did not demonstrate that vitamin D supplementation lowered the risk of heart attack, stroke, or deaths from cardiovascular disease. [47] The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) came to the same conclusion;

The effect was even stronger when vitamin D was combined with calcium: there was a 33% lower risk of T2DM in women when comparing the highest intakes of calcium and vitamin D from supplements (>1,200 mg, >800 IU daily) with the lowest intakes (<600 mg, 400 IU).

Notably, among the participants who had the lowest blood levels of vitamin D at the beginning of the study, vitamin D supplementation did reduce risk of diabetes. This is consistent with the important concept that taking additional vitamin D may not benefit those who already have adequate blood levels, but those with initially low blood levels may benefit.

Vitamin D was first proposed over 40 years ago as having a role in MS given observations at the time including that rates of MS were much higher far north (or far south) of the equator than in sunnier climates, and that geographic regions with diets high in fish had lower rates of MS.

A randomized controlled trial in Japanese school children tested whether taking daily vitamin D supplements would prevent seasonal flu. [67] The trial followed nearly 340 children for four months during the height of the winter flu season. Half of the study participants received pills that contained 1,200 IU of vitamin D; the other half received placebo pills. Researchers found that type A influenza rates in the vitamin D group were about 40% lower than in the placebo group; there was no significant difference in type B influenza rates.

Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D3. The best sources are the flesh of fatty fish and fish liver oils. Smaller amounts are found in egg yolks, cheese, and beef liver. Certain mushrooms contain some vitamin D2; in addition some commercially sold mushrooms contain higher amounts of D2 due to intentionally being exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet light. Many foods and supplements are fortified with vitamin D like dairy products and cereals.

People who are obese tend to have lower blood vitamin D levels. Vitamin D accumulates in excess fat tissues but is not easily available for use by the body when needed. Higher doses of vitamin D supplementation may be needed to achieve a desirable blood level. Conversely, blood levels of vitamin D rise when obese people lose weight.
