Strictly speaking, the hypervisor still runs with the same CPU privilege level (0) as the kernel, but because it uses specialized CPU instructions (VT-x on Intel, SVM on AMD), it can both isolate itself from the kernel while also monitoring it (and applications). For these reasons, you may often hear the term ring -1 thrown around (which is inaccurate).

The role of subsystem DLLs is to translate a documented function into the appropriate internal (and generally undocumented) native system service calls implemented mostly in Ntdll.dll. This translation might or might not involve sending a message to the environment subsystem process that is serving the user process.
