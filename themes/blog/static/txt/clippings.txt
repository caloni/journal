With additional hardware changes to various buses such as PCI and USB, it will soon be possible to support an entire class of secure devices, which, when combined with a minimalistic secure HAL, secure Plug-and-Play manager, and secure User-Mode Device Framework, could allow certain VTL 1 applications direct and segregated access to specially designated devices, such as for biometric or smartcard input.

the Windows subsystem is a required component for any Windows system, even on server systems with no interactive users logged in. Because of this, the process is marked as a critical process (which means if it exits for any reason, the system crashes).

Starting with Windows 7, a separate process is used for each console window on the system: the console window host (Conhost.exe). (A single console window can be shared by multiple console applications, such as when you launch a command prompt from the command prompt. By default, the second command prompt shares the console window of the first.)

With Windows 8 and later, the console architecture changed yet again. The Conhost.exe process remains, but is now spawned from the console-based process (rather than from Csrss.exe, as in Windows 7) by the console driver (\Windows\System32\Drivers\ConDrv.sys). The process in question communicates with Conhost.exe using the console driver (ConDrv.sys), by sending read, write, I/O control and other I/O request types. Conhost.exe is designated as a server and the process using the console is the client. This change obviates the need for Csrss.exe to receive keyboard input (as part of the raw input thread), send it through Win32k.sys to Conhost.exe, and then use ALPC to send it to Cmd.exe. Instead, the command-line application can directly receive input from the console driver through read/write I/Os, avoiding needless context switching.

The real workhorse of Conhost.exe is a DLL it loads (\Windows\System32\ConhostV2.dll) that includes the bulk of code that communicates with the console driver.

With Windows 10 version 1607, one such Pico provider is present: Lxss.sys and its partner Lxcore.sys. As the name suggests, this refers to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) component, and these drivers make up the Pico provider interface for it. Because the Pico provider receives almost all possible transitions to and from user and kernel mode (be they system calls or exceptions, for example), as long as the Pico process (or processes) running underneath it has an address space that it can recognize, and has code that can natively execute within it, the “true” kernel below doesn’t really matter as long as these transitions are handled in a fully transparent way.
