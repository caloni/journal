IA-32 processors support special memory management constructs called segments, but these are not used in Windows and can be safely ignored in most cases. There are several segment registers in IA-32 processors: CS, DS, FS, ES, and SS. On Windows, any mentioning of any of those can be safely ignored except for FS, which allows access to a small area of thread-local memory. Memory accesses that start with FS: are usually accessing that thread-local area.

LEA (load effective address) is essentially an arithmetic instruction—it doesn't perform any actual memory access, but is commonly used for calculating addresses (though you can calculate general purpose integers with it). Don't let the DWORD PTR prefix fool you; this instruction is purely an arithmetic operation.
