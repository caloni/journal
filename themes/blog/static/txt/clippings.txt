Without organization, making any sort of decision becomes impossible. An algorithm might end up going in circles or giving inconvenient output.

When faced with difficult problems, you quickly discover that no magic potion exists for making wishes come true or silver bullets to dispel bad things. Similarly, no algorithmic technique saves the day every time. That’s the no-free-lunch principle often quoted in the book. The good news is, you can arm yourself with different general techniques and test them all on your problem, because you have a good chance that something will work well.

A greedy algorithm reaches a problem solution using sequential steps where, at each step, it makes a decision based on the best solution at that time, without considering future consequences or implications.

Two elements are essential for distinguishing a greedy algorithm: At each turn, you always make the best decision you can at that particular instant. You hope that making a series of best decisions results in the best final solution.

In fact, some problems don’t require farsighted strategies: The solution is built using intermediate results (a sequence of decisions), and at every step the right decision is always the best one according to an initially chosen criteria.

Detailing how a greedy algorithm works (and under what conditions it can work correctly) is straightforward, as explained in the following four steps: You can divide the problem into partial problems. The sum (or other combination) of these partial problems provides the right solution. In this sense, a greedy algorithm isn’t much different from a divide-and-conquer algorithm (like Quicksort or Mergesort, both of which appear in Chapter 7). The successful execution of the algorithm depends on the successful execution of every partial step. This is the optimal substructure characteristic because an optimal solution is made only of optimal subsolutions. To achieve success at each step, the algorithm considers the input data only at that step. That is, situation status (previous decisions) determines the decision the algorithm makes, but the algorithm doesn’t consider consequences. This complete lack of a global strategy is the greedy choice property because being greedy at every phase is enough to offer ultimate success. As an analogy, it’s akin to playing the game of chess by not looking ahead more than one move, and yet winning the game. Because the greedy choice property provides hope for success, a greedy algorithm lacks a complex decision rule because it needs, at worst, to consider all the available input elements at each phase. There is no need to compute possible decision implications; consequently, the computational complexity is at worst linear O(n). Greedy algorithms shine because they take the simple route to solving highly complex problems that other algorithms take forever to compute because they look too deep.

When faced with a new difficult problem, it’s not hard to come up with a greedy solution using the four steps described in the previous section. All you have to do is divide your problems into phases and determine which greedy rule to apply at each step. That is, you do the following: Choose how to make your decision (determine which approach is the simplest, most intuitive, smallest, and fastest) Start solving the problem by applying your decision rule Record the result of your decision (if needed) and determine the status of your problem Repeatedly apply the same approach at every step until reaching the problem conclusion

Puzzle problems, in which the number of possible decisions can become huge, are more frequent than you expect. Some problems of this type have already been solved, but many others aren’t, and we can’t even transform them (yet) into versions we know how to solve. Until someone is smart enough to find a generic solution for these problems, a greedy approach may be the easiest way to approach them, provided that you accept that you won’t always be getting the best solution but a roughly acceptable one instead (in many cases). These difficult problems vary in characteristics and problem domain. Different examples of difficult problems are protein unfolding (which can help cure cancer) or breaking strong password encryption, such as the popular RSA cryptosystem

In the 1960s, researchers found a common pattern for all of them: They are all equally difficult to solve. This pattern is called the NP-completeness theory (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial). In a sense, these problems distinguish themselves from others because it’s not yet possible to find a solution in a reasonable time —that is, in polynomial time. Polynomial time means that an algorithm runs in powers of the number of inputs (known as P problems). Linear time is polynomial time because it runs O(n1). Also quadratic O(n2) and cubic O(n3) complexities are polynomial time, and though they grow quite fast, they don’t compare to NP-complete complexity, which is usually exponential time, that is, O(cn).
