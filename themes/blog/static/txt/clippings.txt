Insulin regulates blood sugar levels. When you eat, blood sugar levels rise, and insulin is released. The food consumed is converted to energy for the body. But if you consume more than your body needs, the excess is stored as fat. When your body is in a fasted state, insulin levels are very low, and the body turns to the stored fat to burn for energy (4).

Insulin is produced by the pancreas. The pancreas is highly sensitive to melatonin. Because you are fasting when you sleep, the body doesn't need high insulin levels to deal with rising blood sugar. Melatonin binds to receptors in the pancreas, slowing down insulin production (5).
