The structure of the coffee bean seems to be essential for the creation of the typical roast flavor of coffee. Experiments showed that ground green coffee powder exposed to similar temperature histories as in bean roasting does not produce the desired flavor compounds. The intact bean acts as an essential “minireactor” for the chemical reactions.

Green coffee beans enter the roasting process with a typical moisture content of about 10–12% [g/100 g, wet base (wb)]. During roasting dehydration takes place. Depending on the roasting conditions the roasted beans may leave the process with a final moisture of about 2.5%.

The highest rate of roast loss is usually found in the early process stages and is mainly caused by dehydration, whereas loss of organic matter is initiated later during the more advanced stages.

Since green coffee in reality is always subject to natural quality fluctuations (e.g., fluctuating green coffee initial moisture content), the roast loss may also fluctuate from one batch to the next, even when roasted to the identical bean color.

During the initial stages of roasting a considerable energy input is required to drive the evaporation of water and to induce chemical reactions (endothermic phase). At one point during roasting, the energy balance of chemical reactions becomes autocatalytic (exothermic). The beans eventually start to generate heat on their own ( Raemy and Lambelet, 1982 ).

Roasting needs to be stopped abruptly at the desired degree of roast with an efficient precooling or cooling step. If roasting continues in an uncontrolled way the beans may catch fire and produce unsafe conditions in a roaster.

The predominant gas formed upon roasting is carbon dioxide (CO2). Other important components include CO and N2. One part of the gas is released to the atmosphere during roasting. Another major part remains entrapped inside the beans and is only released later during storage in a slow desorption process and during subsequent processing steps (e.g., grinding).

The volatile fraction of roasted coffee is highly complex and consists of more than 1000 compounds. Much scientific work has been devoted to the identification of key aroma impact compounds ( Grosch, 2001 ; Poisson et al., 2014 ),

The formation kinetics of aroma compounds during roasting is determined by the specific conditions for chemical reactions (e.g., temperature, water activity, pressure) as controlled by the process parameters (e.g., heat transfer over time). Therefore, different time–temperature conditions during roasting lead to specific flavor profiles obtained from the same raw material.

The first roasting stage does not produce large aroma quantities, but may be important for the formation of aroma precursors. A majority of aroma compounds showed the highest formation rate at medium stages of the roasting process and medium stages of bean dehydration with the water content ranging from 7% to 2% (wb). The majority of important aroma compounds (e.g., most pyrazines) start to decay at high temperature during advanced stages of the process due to thermal degradation. The concentrations of these volatiles decrease with increasing degree of roast. By contrast, a limited number of aroma compounds continue to be created at high temperature (e.g., guaiacol).

As a rule of thumb, increasing degree of roast leads to decreasing acidity and increasing bitterness. Therefore, selecting the optimal degree of roast is crucial for a balanced taste profile.

Although caffeine—which is present in the green bean—has a strong bitter taste, it contributes only some 10–20% to the sensory perceived bitterness in coffee.

The main contributors to bitterness are formed by roasting. The class of chlorogenic acid lactones—a break down product of chlorogenic acids—has been identified as one of the main contributors to bitterness in coffee ( Hofmann, 2008 ).

Moderate quantities of quenching water will not affect the flavor or the physical bean properties. By contrast, excessive amount of quenching water will result in water absorption and therefore increase the final bean moisture. Hence, water quenching may also be used to adjust and control the final bean moisture. High water activity in the roasted bean results in an accelerated staling process and may affect flavor stability and shorten the product shelf-life.

Very simplified, the pleasant and delightful coffee aroma builds up to a certain optimal degree of roast, but then decreases again upon continued roasting. In a similar way the sensory attribute “body” or “mouthfeel” increases to a certain point and then decreases on continued roasting beyond this point. An over-roasted coffee may yield strong intensity of “roasty note” at cup tasting, but very often lacks “body” and produces a sensory perception known as “thin” or “weak mouthfeel.” Depending on the origin and characteristics of green beans, different degrees of roast are required to exploit the natural flavor potential to its best.

In general, more soluble matter can be extracted from fast roasted beans. This may be due to greater generation of soluble matter or to better accessibility for the water in high porosity structure or to both.
