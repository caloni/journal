Roasters often keep track of percent weight loss to help identify which batches might deserve extra scrutiny in quality assurance.

Coffee beans have some of the strongest cell walls in the plant kingdom. They have external rings that reinforce the cell, increasing its stiffness and strength.

Roasting also increases porosity, making the beans less dense and much more soluble. This, of course, is vital to making them into a delicious drink.

The lipids help to keep volatile compounds inside the cell. Volatile compounds are chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature, some of which are essential to creating the flavor and aroma of coffee. Without the oils, they might disperse.

But whatever roast profile you choose, there are three main phases: drying, browning or the Maillard reaction, and development. These popular terms actually describe different stages of chemical and physical changes.

When you see the coffee beans start to turn brown, the Maillard reaction has started. This happens at around 150°C/302°F.

After first crack, the roast changes from an endothermic reaction (the beans absorb heat from the drum) to an exothermic one (the beans release heat).

The change in color is due to the production of melanoidins. These are large molecules that not only turn the beans brown, but contribute to mouthfeel and body.

Small changes in the temperature and length of time spent in the Maillard reaction can have a big impact on the final profile of a coffee.

Coffee that has spent longer in the Maillard reaction has been reported to have an increase in viscosity. A shorter Maillard duration can create more perception of sweetness and acidity. This is in part because the acids that produce fruity and sweet notes are destroyed if the coffee remains in the Maillard reaction for too long.

When roasters experiment with roast profiles, it includes varying the length and intensity of Maillard reaction and recording its effects on profile.

Many non-volatile compounds contribute to flavor and profile. Examples include caffeine, which is responsible for some bitter flavors. Caffeine is naturally occurring in coffee and remains unchanged by the roasting process.

For example, the citric and tartaric acids that produce fruity and sweet notes are broken down during roasting so a long or overly hot roast can hugely reduce the sweetness of the final profile.

Because, as Mané says, “acidity can complement or unbalance the harmony of a coffee cup. If a coffee is more acidic it can become sour, people don’t like the coffee.” And without acidity? “Then the coffee will taste ‘flat.’”

Organic acids include citric, malic, quinic, acetic, succinic, and tartaric acids. These are the “good,” fruity acids that you want to taste in the cup.

According to Mané, each origin has a “certain type of soil characteristics and a certain amount of a certain acid.”

The Arabica species, for example, tends to have less chlorogenic acids which decreases its perceived acidity. Certain varieties, such as the SL-28 that you’ll find in Kenya, are more acidic. Part of this is just genetics. Yet part of it is also because of the farming conditions. Certain varieties are more suited to being grown in cooler temperatures than others – and that also has an impact on the flavor.

Coffee that is grown at cooler temperatures tends to ripen slower, allowing the development of more complex flavors. When brewed, it tends to be more acidic and aromatic than those coffees grown in warmer climates – say, lower down the same mountain.

For example, wet/washed coffees are pulped and rinsed in water, removing layers of sucrose and fructose content. This allows the acidity to shine, unfiltered by that sweetness. On the other hand, naturally processed coffees leave the fruit intact while the coffee dries, increasing the overall sweetness and overpowering the perceived acidity.

You cannot create a flavor, in roasting or brewing, that a coffee doesn’t have. However, you can roast it in a way that will highlight or obscure the acidity.

But roasting isn’t just about how long you keep the beans in the roaster. It’s about how you manipulate the heat and airflow throughout to enhance the coffee’s best characteristics.

Your aim should be an early first crack that doesn’t last too long – something that goes hand-in-hand with high heat. But don’t forget, too early or too short will also lead to sourness.

Try roasting and cupping your coffee with different development times and profiles. This should give you a better understanding of how your roast profile affects the coffee’s acidity. The more you do this, the more insights you will get!

the moment the water makes contact with your coffee, the flavor and aroma compounds begin to diffuse into the water – this is extraction.

The degree of extraction will affect the flavors and aromas in the cup, since not all compounds are extracted at the same time.

Fruity and acidic notes are extracted first, followed by sweetness and balance, and then finally bitterness. This means that under-extracting will lead to a sour taste, as it doesn’t have the sweetness and slight hint of bitterness necessary to balance the acidity. But over-extracting will taste bitter, as the sweetness and acidity will be overwhelmed. You want the perfect balance.

The finer the grind size, the more quickly extraction happens (note: extraction time is different to brew time). A coarse grind size means more acidity; a fine grind size, more bitterness. The longer the brew time, the more time extraction will happen. Short brews are more acidic; longer ones, more bitter. The hotter the water, the more quickly the extraction will happen – but too cool a water temperature and the acids won’t extract.

So, aim for a relatively high water temperature but a coarser grind size and shorter brew time for a more acidic cup. Grind finer and brew for longer if it’s coming out sour. Or, brew cool to avoid acids – but don’t forget that you’ll need to increase your brew time, since extraction takes longer at lower temperatures.

The mid-palate is the moment between the first sip and the swallow – in other words, the majority of the consumer’s coffee-drinking experience. Beverages that are dissatisfying during the mid-palate are often called “hollow”.

Previously published scientific papers show that green coffee beans contain a high concentration of sucrose. In the early stages of the roasting process, this sucrose is transformed to flavor molecules which are often linked to the sour and bitter taste of coffee.

Coffee’s most famous molecule, it’s what makes you feel awake and energized. But when it comes to flavor, caffeine is reported to have a strong, bitter taste. In fact, caffeine has been found to be a significant contributor to the bitterness which forms our perception of the coffee’s “strength” (although it’s certainly not the only factor).

The world’s most popular coffee processing methods are natural, washed, and honey. Natural processed coffees are dried, hulled and milled. Washed (or wet) coffees are pulped and then fermented to remove the mesocarp (also known as mucilage) layer before being dried and milled. Honey processing bridges the gap between wet and natural coffees; the coffee cherry is pulped and then dried with the mucilage layer on the parchment.

The next stage is the most intricate and sensitive part of the process: the drying phase. You have to get the timing of this perfect. It’s crucial that you don’t dry the beans too quickly. If you do, the flavours won’t be converted from the mucilage to the bean. It’s also crucial that you don’t dry the beans too slowly. You need to be quick enough to avoid fermentation within the bean, otherwise you’ll end up with mouldy coffee.

The first thing the farmers do is pick only the ripest cherries from the trees. The beans are then pulped from their outer skin, and as mentioned above, left in a layer of mucilage. This mucilage layer contains a high amount of sucrose (sugar) and acids which is really the key of the honey process.

Honey processed coffees generally possess great sweetness and a balanced acidity with fruity undertones. The flavours are typically less powerful than natural processed coffee, but the clarity and definition of them is much clearer and more pronounced. Who doesn’t want that?
