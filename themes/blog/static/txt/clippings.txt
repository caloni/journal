In reality, however, Selection Sort is described in Big O as O(N2), just like Bubble Sort. This is because of a major rule of Big O that I’m now introducing for the first time: Big O Notation ignores constants.

This is simply a mathematical way of saying that Big O Notation never includes regular numbers that aren’t an exponent. We simply drop these regular numbers from the expression.

However, when two algorithms fall under the same classification of Big O, it doesn’t necessarily mean that both algorithms have the same speed. After all, Bubble Sort is twice as slow as Selection Sort even though both are O(N2). So, while Big O is perfect for contrasting algorithms that fall under different classifications of Big O, when two algorithms fall under the same classification, further analysis is required to determine which algorithm is faster.

Big O Notation only takes into account the highest order of N when we have multiple orders added together.

That is, if we have an algorithm that takes N4 + N3 + N2 + N steps, we only consider N4 to be significant—and just call it O(N4). Why is this?
